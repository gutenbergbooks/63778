  <h2 class='c005'>EDITOR’S PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The fate which usually attends political and satirical
writings that owe their origin to passing events, has in
no way affected the <span class='sc'>Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</span>, which,
after a lapse of more than ninety years, still continues to
interest and amuse. Public opinion never fails, sooner
or later, to arrive at a just conclusion as to the merits
both of individuals and actions; and though it may often
neglect to preserve a meritorious work, never perpetuates
a worthless one. Poetry which lashed with so remorseless
a hand the patriotic proceedings, and held up to
ridicule the persons and habits, of the most distinguished
Whig leaders, must have possessed no common merit to
have won the encomiums of such liberal politicians and
such critics as <span class='sc'>Mackintosh</span> and <span class='sc'>Jeffrey</span>, <span class='sc'>Moore</span> and
<span class='sc'>Byron</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Moore</span>, in his <cite>Life of Sheridan</cite>, observes: “<cite>The Rolliad</cite>
and <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite> may, on their respective sides of the
question, be considered as models of that style of political
satire whose lightness and vivacity give it the appearance
of proceeding rather from the wantonness of wit than of
ill-nature, and whose very malice, from the fancy with
which it is mixed up, like certain kinds of fire-works,
explodes in sparkles”. This criticism might be applied
to some of his own political squibs.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>As the poems refer to occurrences long since past, a
rapid glance at the state of events at that time (1797–8)
may render them more intelligible to the generality of
readers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The affairs of England were then in a critical position.
The ministry of <span class='sc'>Pitt</span> was carrying on a fierce war with
republican France, the necessity for which had split the
public into two great parties. The liberal party alleged,
that “the whole misfortunes of Europe and all the crimes
of France had arisen from the iniquitous coalition of
kings to overturn its infant freedom;—that, if its government
had been left alone, it would neither have stained
its hands with innocent blood at home nor pursued plans
of aggrandizement abroad; and that the Republic, relieved
from the pressure of external danger, and no longer
roused by the call of patriotic duty, would have quietly
turned its swords into pruning-hooks, and, renouncing
the allurements of foreign conquests, thought only of
promoting the internal felicity of its citizens”.</p>

<p class='c007'>These sentiments, though supported by the extraordinary
eloquence of <span class='sc'>Fox</span>, <span class='sc'>Sheridan</span>, <span class='sc'>Erskine</span>, and
others, had but little weight with the minister or the
great body of the public. It was impossible to deny
that the power of the French Republic was daily increasing,
and threatened the subjugation of the greater part
of Europe. <span class='sc'>Buonaparte</span> had overrun Italy, and broken
the power of Austria, which, by the treaty of Leoben,
was compelled to cede the Netherlands to France, allow
the free navigation of the Rhine, and recognise the independence
of the newly-erected Italian republics.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>Spain, also, had declared war against Britain, which
was thus left to contend singly against the power of
France; for the Directory had refused the basis of peace
proposed by <span class='sc'>Lord Malmesbury</span>, that of a mutual restitution
of conquests. To add to these embarrassments, during
the year 1797 credit became affected, and the Bank
of England suspended cash payments; mutinies broke
out in the fleets at Spithead and the Nore; and Ireland
was on the verge of rebellion. But the talents of <span class='sc'>Pitt</span>
were equal to the occasion, and his power rose higher
than ever, when his prognostications were shortly after
(in December, 1797) confirmed by the unprovoked attack
upon Switzerland by the French. The impolicy of this
proceeding was equal to its infamy; for nothing ever
done by the revolutionary government contributed so
powerfully to cool the ardour of its partisans in Europe,
and to open the eyes of the intelligent and respectable
classes in every other country to its ultimate designs.
Its effect on the friends of freedom in England may be
judged of from the indignant protest of <span class='sc'>Sir James
Mackintosh</span>, himself once a warm admirer of the French
Revolution, who, in his defence of <span class='sc'>Jean Peltier</span>, in 1803,
for a libel on <span class='sc'>Buonaparte</span>, declared, “the invasion and
destruction of Switzerland an act, in comparison with
which all the deeds of rapine and blood perpetrated in
the world are innocence itself”. Even before this, the
true character of the revolution had been detected by
the democratic <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span>, who gave public utterance
to his feelings of horror and disgust in that noble <cite>Ode to
France</cite> written in February, 1797. In a word, to say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>nothing of her other conquests, France, at the beginning
of 1798, had three affiliated republics at her side, the
Batavian, Cisalpine, and the Ligurian; before its close
she had organized three more, the Helvetic, the Roman,
and the Parthenopeian.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pitt’s</span> influence was further increased by the threatened
invasion of Great Britain by the French, a proceeding
which, as it affected every class in the country, raised
the national enthusiasm to the highest pitch, inflamed
as it already was by the recent glorious victories off Cape
St. Vincent and Camperdown. That they were likely
to be in earnest had been already shown by their expeditions
to Bantry Bay and Pembrokeshire, and <span class='sc'>Buonaparte’s</span>
boast at Geneva, that “he would democratize
England in three months,” proved how much he relied
upon the support of the malcontents both in Great
Britain and Ireland. The estimates and preparations for
defence were, enormous; taxes, to an extent utterly unknown
before, were laid on; the Volunteer Bill was
passed (<span class='sc'>Sheridan</span> assisting), by which, in addition to the
regular army, a hundred and fifty thousand volunteers
were, in a few weeks, in arms; <span class='sc'>The King</span> was authorized
by another bill, in the event of an invasion, to call out the
levy, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></i>, of the population; the Alien Bill was reenacted;
and the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act
continued for another year.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the genius of one man, however great, can effect
but little, unless suitably supported by others. The sagacious
mind of <span class='sc'>Pitt</span> had long seen that his party in
Parliament were, with very few exceptions, no match for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>his numerous opponents, powerful both in talent and
social position; among whom were <span class='sc'>Fox</span>, <span class='sc'>Sheridan</span>,
<span class='sc'>Erskine</span>, <span class='sc'>Horne Tooke</span>, <span class='sc'>Whitbread</span>, <span class='sc'>Nicholls</span>, <span class='sc'>Courtenay</span>,
<span class='sc'>Fitzpatrick</span>, the <span class='sc'>Dukes</span> of <span class='sc'>Norfolk</span> and <span class='sc'>Bedford</span>,
<span class='sc'>Lord Stanhope</span>, the <span class='sc'>Duchess</span> of <span class='sc'>Devonshire</span>, and others.
He was always anxious, therefore, to secure whatever
available talent presented itself, and immediately on their
appearance enlisted under his banners <span class='sc'>Canning</span>, <span class='sc'>Jenkinson</span>,
<span class='sc'>Huskisson</span>, and <span class='sc'>Castlereagh</span>, all men of the same
standing, for the first three were born in 1770, and the
last in 1769.</p>

<p class='c007'>The important assistance of <span class='sc'>Canning</span> was immediately
felt, for he was, in the words of <span class='sc'>Byron</span>, “a genius—almost
a universal one; an orator, a wit, a poet, a statesman”.
Though he entered Parliament at the early age
of 23 (in 1793), and attained the post of Under-Secretary
of State for the Foreign Department two years after, he
was by no means inexperienced either as a writer or as an
orator; for while a student at Eton he had won distinction
by his contributions to <cite>The Microcosm</cite>, a weekly paper
published by the more advanced Etonians, and also in
the discussions of their Debating Society, which were
conducted with strict regard to parliamentary usages.
And afterwards, while studying for the law, he took an
active part in the proceedings of the debating societies of
the metropolis, in which he achieved so much reputation
as to lead to his introduction to <span class='sc'>Pitt</span>, whose party he
unhesitatingly joined.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Canning</span> early saw the necessity of the Government’s
possessing some literary engine, which, like the Whig
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span><cite>Rolliad</cite>, published some years before, should carry confusion
into the ranks of its enemies. In a lucky hour he
conceived the idea of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>, a weekly newspaper,
interspersed with poetry, the avowed object of
which was to expose the vicious doctrines of the French
Revolution, and to turn into ridicule and contempt the
advocates of that event, and the sticklers for peace and
parliamentary reform. The editor was <span class='sc'>William Gifford</span>,
whose vigorous and unscrupulous pen had been already
shown in his <cite>Baviad</cite> and <cite>Mæviad</cite>; and among the regular
writers were: <span class='sc'>John Hookham Frere</span>, <span class='sc'>Jenkinson</span> (afterwards
<span class='sc'>Earl of Liverpool</span>), <span class='sc'>George Ellis</span> (who had
previously contributed to the Whig <cite>Rolliad</cite>), <span class='sc'>Lord Clare</span>,
<span class='sc'>Lord Mornington</span> (afterwards <span class='sc'>Marquis Wellesley</span>),
<span class='sc'>Lord Morpeth</span> (afterwards <span class='sc'>Earl of Carlisle</span>), <span class='sc'>Baron
Macdonald</span>, and others. These gentlemen entered upon
their task with no common spirit. Their purpose was
to blacken their adversaries, and they spared no means,
fair or foul, in the attempt. Their most distinguished
countrymen, whose only fault was their being opposed to
government, were treated with no more respect than their
foreign adversaries, and were held up to public execration
as traitors, blasphemers, and debauchees. So alarmed,
however, became <span class='sc'>Wilberforce</span> and others of the more
moderate supporters of ministers at the boldness of the
language employed, that <span class='sc'>Pitt</span> was induced to interfere,
and, after an existence of eight months, <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>
(in its original form) ceased to exist.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</cite> is not exclusively political.
<cite>The Loves of the Triangles</cite>, a parody on <span class='sc'>Dr. Darwin’s</span> <cite>Loves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>of the Plants</cite>, is, in the opinion of a celebrated critic (Lord
Jeffrey) of the highest degree of merit; as is also <cite>The
Progress of Man</cite>, a parody on <span class='sc'>Payne Knight’s</span> <cite>Progress of
Civil Society</cite>; and <cite>The Rovers</cite>, a burlesque on the German
dramas then in vogue, the extraordinary plots of which,
as well as their language, alternately ultrasentimental
and domestically bathotic, well marked them out for
ridicule, is distinguished by sharp wit and broad humour
of the happiest kind. <span class='sc'>Canning</span> and his coadjutors in this
piece did a real service to literature, and assisted in a
purification which <span class='sc'>Gifford</span>, by his demolition of the Della
Cruscan school of poetry, had so well begun. Of <cite>The
Friend of Humanity and the Knife-grinder</cite> it is unnecessary
to speak; perhaps no lines in the English language have
been more effective, or oftener quoted.</p>

<p class='c007'>But <span class='sc'>Canning’s</span> greatest power is shown in <cite>New Morality</cite>,
which, being the last of the series, seems to have been
reserved as a concentrating medium for his pent-up scorn
and contempt of the Whigs and their adherents. So that
their blows fall thick (for he was powerfully seconded by
Frere, Gifford, and Ellis), they care little who suffer from
them, and the modern reader is surprised to find <span class='sc'>Charles
Lamb</span> and other non-intruders into politics, figuring as
congenial conspirators with <span class='sc'>Tom Paine</span>!</p>

<p class='c007'>It is somewhat difficult to regard <span class='sc'>Pitt</span> in the character
of a Wit and a Poet, as from the narrative of most of his
biographers, he might be considered as uniformly cold,
stiff, and unbending; but his intimate friend <span class='sc'>Wilberforce</span>,
in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, thus describes him: “<span class='sc'>Pitt</span>, when
free from shyness, and amongst his intimate companions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>was the very soul of merriment and conversation. He
was the wittiest man I ever knew, and what was quite
peculiar to himself, had at all times his wit under entire
controul. Others appeared struck by the unwonted
association of brilliant images; but every possible combination
of ideas seemed always present to his mind, and
he could at once produce whatever he desired. I was one
of those who met to spend an evening in memory of
Shakespeare, at the Boar’s Head, Eastcheap. Many
professed wits were present, but <span class='sc'>Pitt</span> was the most
amusing of the party, the readiest and most apt in the
required allusions.” It is not, therefore, at all unlikely,
that he now and then contributed witty verses to <cite>The
Anti-Jacobin</cite>, in addition to those which the Editor has,
on probable grounds, ascribed to him in the present
volume.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Critical commentary,” says a critic of the previous
edition, “on the merits of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>, would be
superfluous. Its satire is distinguished for the terse
language of its poignant personality, which was often
excessively stinging, but seldom offensively coarse. Its
best contributors, <span class='sc'>Canning</span> and <span class='sc'>Frere</span>, were not mere
pamphleteers in verse, like the writers for <cite>The Rolliad</cite>.
They had poetical inspiration and a sprightly joyousness
springing from a genial play of the mental faculties.
They were ‘Conservatives’ not only in their politics but
in their loyal adherence to the ordinances and traditions
of classical English literature. False sentiment, tumid
diction, mawkish cant, were chastised by them with
exemplary efficacy. On the fourth edition of the complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>work (1799, 2 Vols. 8vo, containing both prose and
poetry), they placed the epigraph, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sparsosque recolligit
ignes</span></i>; and in the very last paper (No. 36), the motto on
discontinuance was exquisitely happy:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>Be free; and fare thou well!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“And these lines, taken from <cite>The Tempest</cite> (probably by
<span class='sc'>Canning</span>), have been prophetic of the popularity of their
witty verse, still quoted and admired by all lovers of the
genius that is airily elegant and strong.”</p>

Censor. From the commencement in July, 1798, to its close in 1821.
(<em>The first few vols. contain engravings by Gillray and others, and much</em>
<span class='sc'>Poetry</span> <em>is scattered through the volumes</em>.) 61 vols. 8vo.</p>
<div class='c015'>London, 1798–1821.</div>

<p class='c007'>For reasons stated on a previous page, <span class='sc'>Canning</span> and other political friends
of <span class='sc'>Pitt</span> thought it prudent to withdraw themselves from the original <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite>,
but by a preconcerted arrangement it was determined that the spirit
which had pervaded that work, and which had had so powerful an effect on the
popular mind, and thereby, in connection with Gillray’s caricatures, so undoubtedly
strengthened the hands of the Ministry, should not die, if it could be
kept alive by other and congenial writers. In the words of <span class='sc'>Mr. Fox Bourne</span>
(in his valuable work on <cite>English Newspapers</cite>, 1887): “Though <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>
made its last appearance on July 9, 1798, there was started a few days before a
monthly <cite>Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine</cite> of the same politics, but much less
brilliant, and more ponderous. Strange to say, it also was edited by a <span class='sc'>Gifford</span>,
or one who so called himself. <span class='sc'>John Richards Green</span> was a bold and versatile
adventurer, who, having to fly from his creditors in 1782, returned from France
in 1788, as <span class='sc'>John Gifford</span>, and was connected with several newspapers [including
the establishment of <cite>The British Critic</cite>], besides editing <cite>The Anti-Jacobin
Review</cite>. [He also wrote a <cite>History of France</cite>, and other works.] Befriended in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>many ways by <span class='sc'>Pitt</span>, he wrote a four-volume pamphlet [3 vols. 4to, and also
6 vols. 8vo, both dated 1809], styled the <cite>Life of William Pitt</cite>, after his patron’s
death. <span class='sc'>James Mill</span>, the friend and associate of <span class='sc'>Jeremy Bentham</span>, was glad
to earn money in his struggling days by writing non-political articles for <cite>The
Anti-Jacobin Review</cite>. <span class='sc'>William Gifford</span>, it is hardly necessary to state, besides
editing Ben Jonson’s Works, and other useful occupations, was the first editor
of <cite>The Quarterly Review</cite> in 1809.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the British Museum are two copies of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin Review and
Magazine</cite>. In one of them the first six vols. contain the Names of the Authors
of most of the articles, among whom are the <span class='sc'>Rev. John Whitaker</span>, author of
<cite>The History of Manchester</cite>, the <span class='sc'>Rev. Sam. Henshall</span>, author of works on Domesday

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Wright</span>, the publisher of the <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite>, lived at 169, Piccadilly, and
his shop was the general morning resort of the friends of the ministry, as
<span class='sc'>Debrett’s</span> was of the oppositionists. About the time when the <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite>
was contemplated, <span class='sc'>Owen</span>, who had been the publisher of <span class='sc'>Burke’s</span> pamphlets,
failed. The editors of the <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite> took his house, paying the rent, taxes,
&amp;c., and gave it up to <span class='sc'>Wright</span>, reserving to themselves the first floor, to which
a communication was opened through <span class='sc'>Wright’s</span> house. Being thus enabled to
pass to their own rooms through <span class='sc'>Wright’s</span> shop, where their frequent visits
did not excite any remarks, they contrived to escape particular observation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Their meetings were most regular on Sundays, but they not unfrequently
met on other days of the week, and in their rooms were chiefly written the
poetical portions of the work. What was written was generally left open upon the
table, and as others of the party dropped in, hints or suggestions were made;
sometimes whole passages were contributed by some of the parties present, and
afterwards altered by others, so that it is almost impossible to ascertain the
names of the authors. Where, in the above notes, a piece is ascribed to different
authors, the conflicting statements may arise from incorrect information, but
sometimes they arise from the whole authorship being assigned to one person,
when, in fact, both may have contributed. If we look at the references, 167,
185, we shall see <span class='sc'>Canning</span> naming several authors, whereas <span class='sc'>Lord Burghersh</span>
assigns all to one author. <span class='sc'>Canning’s</span> authority is here more to be relied upon.
<cite>New Morality</cite> <span class='sc'>Canning</span> assigns generally to the four contributors. <span class='sc'>Wright</span> has
given some interesting particulars by appropriating to each his peculiar portion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Gifford</span> was the working editor, and wrote most of the refutations and
corrections of the <em>Lies</em>, <em>Mistakes</em>, and <em>Misrepresentations</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The papers on finance were chiefly by <span class='sc'>Pitt</span>: the first column was frequently
kept for what he might send; but his contributions were uncertain, and generally
very late, so that the space reserved for him was sometimes filled up by other
matter. He only once met the editors at <span class='sc'>Wright’s</span>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>W. Upcott</span>, who was at the time assistant in <span class='sc'>Wright’s</span> shop, was employed
as amanuensis, to copy out for the printer the various contributions, that
the author’s handwriting might not be detected.”—<em>E. Hawkins.</em></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>[The following is part of a review, under the above title, of the present editor’s
previous edition of <cite>The Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</cite>, and appeared in <cite>The Edinburgh
Review</cite> of July, 1858. It is reprinted in the <cite>Biographical and Critical Essays</cite> of
<span class='sc'>A. Hayward</span>, Esq., Q.C., 2 vols., 8vo., 1873. It is introduced here as throwing
some additional light on the <cite>Writers of the various pieces</cite>.]</p>

<p class='c006'>“... We can hardly say of <span class='sc'>Canning’s</span> satire what was said of <span class='sc'>Sheridan’s</span>,
that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>“‘His wit in the combat, as gentle as bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>Never carried a heart-stain away on its blade’.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>But its severity was redeemed by its buoyancy and geniality, whilst the subjects
against which it was principally aimed gave it a healthy tone and a sound
foundation. Its happiest effusions will be found in <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>, set on foot
to refute or ridicule the democratic rulers of revolutionary France and their
admirers or apologists in England, who, it must be owned, were occasionally
hurried into a culpable degree of extravagance and laxity by their enthusiasm....”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We learn from <span class='sc'>Mr. Edmonds</span> that almost all his authorities practically
resolve themselves into one, the late <span class='sc'>Mr. W. Upcott</span>, and that he never saw
either of the alleged copies on which his informant relied. As regards the
principal one, <span class='sc'>Canning’s</span> own, after the fullest inquiries amongst his surviving
relatives and friends, we cannot discover a trace of its existence at any period.
<span class='sc'>Lord Burghersh</span> (the late <span class='sc'>Earl of Westmoreland</span>) was under fourteen
years of age during the publication of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>; and we very much
doubt whether either the publisher or the amanuensis (be he who he may) was
admitted to the complete confidence of the contributors, or whether either the
prose or poetry was composed as stated. In a letter to the late <span class='sc'>Madame de
Girardin</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</span></i> of her play, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’École des Journalistes</span></cite>, <span class='sc'>Jules Janin</span> happily
exposes the assumption that good leading articles ever were, or ever could be,
produced over punch and broiled bones, amidst intoxication and revelry.
Equally untenable is the belief that poetical pieces, like the best of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>,
were written in the common rooms of the confraternity, open to
constant intrusion, and left upon the table to be corrected or completed by the
first comer. The unity of design discernible in each, the glowing harmony of
the thoughts and images, and the exquisite finish of the versification, tell of
silent and solitary hours spent in brooding over, maturing, and polishing a
cherished conception; and young authors, still unknown to fame, are least of
all likely to sink their individuality in this fashion. We suspect that their
main object in going to <span class='sc'>Wright’s</span> was to correct their proofs and see one
another’s articles in the more finished state. Their meetings, if for these
purposes, would be most regular on Sundays, because the paper appeared
every Monday morning. The extent to which they aided one another may be
collected from a well-authenticated anecdote. When <span class='sc'>Frere</span> had completed
the first part of <cite>The Loves of the Triangles</cite>, he exultingly read over the following
lines to <span class='sc'>Canning</span>, and defied him to improve upon them:—</p>

bound volume containing all the numbers of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite> as they originally
appeared, eight pages quarto, with double columns, price sixpence. On the
fly-leaf is inscribed: ‘This copy belonged to the Marquess Wellesley, and was
purchased at the sale of his library after his death, January, 1842. H.’ On
the cover is pasted an engraved label of the arms and name of a former
proprietor, <span class='sc'>Charles William Flint</span>, with the pencilled addition of ‘Confidential
Amanuensis’. In this copy <span class='sc'>Canning’s</span> name is subscribed to (amongst
others) the following pieces, which are also assigned to him (along with a large
share in the most popular of the rest) by the most trustworthy rumours and
traditions:—<em>Inscription for the Door of the Cell in Newgate where Mrs. Brownrigg,
the Prenticide, was confined previous to her execution; The Friend of Humanity and

rather than blush, at this allusion to their sires, and smile the more when they
remember from which side the attack proceeded. It is clear from the Answer,
that, whilst the band were not a little ruffled, they had not the remotest suspicion
that their assailant was a youth in his nineteenth year. Amongst other prefatory
remarks they say:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘We assure the author of the epistle, that the answer which we have here
the honour to address to him, contains our genuine and undisguised sentiments

curiosity upon this subject—but we have little anxiety for the gratification of
our own.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘It is only necessary to add, what is most conscientiously the truth, that this
production, such as it is, is <em>by far the best</em> of all the attacks that the combined
wits of the cause have been able to muster against <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Answer opens thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘<span class='sc'>Bard</span> of the borrow’d lyre! to whom belong</div>

<p class='c007'>“The ‘one good line’ was ‘By Leveson Gower’s crop-imitating wig,’ but the
Epistle contains many equally good and some better. The speculations as to
its authorship afforded no slight amusement to the writer and his friends....</p>

<p class='c007'>“<cite>New Morality</cite> is commonly regarded as the master-piece of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>;
and, with the exception of a few lines, the whole of it is by <span class='sc'>Canning</span>. It appeared
in the last number, and he is said to have concentrated all his energies
for a parting blow. The reader who comes fresh from <span class='sc'>Dryden</span> or <span class='sc'>Pope</span>, or even
<span class='sc'>Churchill</span>, will be disappointed on finding far less variety of images, sparkling
antithesis, or condensed brilliancy of expression. The author exhibits abundant
humour and eloquence, but comparatively little wit; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, if there be any truth
in <span class='sc'>Sydney Smith’s</span> doctrine ‘that the feeling of wit is occasioned by those
relations of ideas which excite surprise, and surprise <em>alone</em>’. We are commonly
prepared for what is coming, and our admiration is excited rather by the justness
of the observations, the elevation of the thoughts, and the vigour of the
style, than by a startling succession of flashes of fancy. If, as we believe, the
same might be said of <span class='sc'>Juvenal</span>, and the best of his English imitators, <span class='sc'>Johnson</span>,
we leave ample scope for praise; and <cite>New Morality</cite> contains passages which have
been preserved to our time and bid fair to reach posterity. How often are the
lines on <em>Candour</em> quoted in entire ignorance or forgetfulness of their author....</p>

<p class='c007'>“The drama of <cite>The Rovers</cite>, or <cite>Double Arrangement</cite>, was written to ridicule the
German Drama, then hardly known in this country, except through the medium
of bad translations of some of the least meritorious of <span class='sc'>Schiller’s</span>, <span class='sc'>Goethe’s</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Kotzebue’s</span> productions. The parody is now principally remembered by
Rogero’s song, of which, Mr. Edmonds states, the first five stanzas were by
<span class='sc'>Canning</span>. “Having been accidentally seen, previously to its publication, by
<span class='sc'>Pitt</span>, he was so amused with it that he took a pen and composed the last stanza
on the spot....”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>“<span class='sc'>Canning’s</span> reputed share in <cite>The Rovers</cite> excited the unreasoning indignation,
and provoked the exaggerated censure, of a man who has obtained a world-wide
reputation by his historical researches, most especially by his skill in separating
the true from the fabulous, and in filling up chasms in national annals by a process
near akin to that by which <span class='sc'>Cuvier</span> inferred the entire form and structure
of an extinct species from a bone. The following passage is taken from
<span class='sc'>Niebuhr’s</span> <cite>History of the Period of the Revolution</cite> (published from his Lectures, in
two volumes, in 1845):—</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘<span class='sc'>Canning</span> was at that time (1807) at the head of foreign affairs in England.
History will not form the same judgment of him as that formed by contemporaries.
He had great talents, but was not a great Statesman; he was one of
those persons who distinguish themselves as the squires of political heroes.
He was highly accomplished in the two classical languages, but without being
a learned scholar. He was especially conversant with Greek writers. He had
likewise poetical talent, but only for Satire. At first he had joined the leaders
of opposition against <span class='sc'>Pitt’s</span> ministry: <span class='sc'>Lord Grey</span>, who perceived his ambition,
advised him, half in joke, to join the ministers, as he would make his fortune.
He did so, and was employed to write articles for the newspapers and satirical
verses, which were often directed against his former benefactors.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Through the influence of the ministers he came into Parliament. So long
as the great eloquence of former times lasted, and the great men were alive, his
talent was admired; but older persons had no great pleasure in his petulant,
epigrammatic eloquence and his jokes, which were often in bad taste. He
joined the Society of the Anti-Jacobins, which defended everything connected
with existing institutions. This society published a journal, in which the most
honoured names of foreign countries were attacked in the most scandalous
manner. German literature was at that time little known in England, and it
was associated there with the ideas of Jacobinism and revolution. <span class='sc'>Canning</span>
then published in <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite> the most shameful pasquinade which was
ever written against Germany, under the title of <em>Matilda Pottingen</em>. Göttingen
is described in it as the sink of all infamy; professors and students as a gang of
miscreants; licentiousness, incest, and atheism as the character of the German
people. Such was <span class='sc'>Canning’s</span> beginning: he was at all events useful, a sort of
political Cossack’ (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte des Zeitalters der Revolution</span></cite>, vol. ii., p. 242).</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Here am I,’ exclaimed <span class='sc'>Raleigh</span>, after vainly trying to get at the rights of
a squabble in the courtyard of the Tower, ‘employed in writing a true history
of the world, when I cannot ascertain the truth of what happens under my
own window.’ Here is the great restorer of Roman history—who, by the way,
prided himself on his knowledge of England—hurried into the strangest
misconception of contemporary events and personages, and giving vent to a series
of depreciatory misstatements, without pausing to verify the assumed groundwork
of his patriotic wrath. His description of ‘the most shameful pasquinade,’
and his ignorance of the very title, prove that he had never seen it. If he had,
he would also have known that the scene is laid at Weimar, not at Göttingen,
and that the satire is almost exclusively directed against a portion of the
dramatic literature of his country, which all rational admirers must admit to be
indefensible. The scene in <cite>The Rovers</cite>, in which the rival heroines, meeting for
the first time at an inn, swear eternal friendship and embrace, is positively a
feeble reflection of a scene in <span class='sc'>Goethe’s</span> <em>Stella</em>; and no anachronism can exceed
that in <span class='sc'>Schiller’s</span> <cite>Cabal und Liebe</cite>, when Lady Milford, after declaring herself
the daughter of the Duke of Norfolk who rebelled against Queen Elizabeth, is
horrified on finding that the jewels sent her by the Grand Duke have been
purchased by the sale of 7000 of his subjects to be employed in the American
war.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c024'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>“Amongst the prose contributions to <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>, there is one in which,
independently of direct evidence, the peculiar humour of <span class='sc'>Canning</span> is discernible,—the
pretended report of the meeting of the Friends of Freedom at the Crown
and Anchor Tavern.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c024'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The plan was evidently suggested by <span class='sc'>Tickell’s</span> <cite>Anticipation</cite>,
in which the debate on the Address at the opening of the Session was
reported beforehand with such surprising foresight, that some of the speakers,
who were thus forestalled, declined to deliver their meditated orations.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At the meeting of the Friends of Freedom, <span class='sc'>Erskine</span>, whose habitual
egotism could hardly be caricatured, is made to perorate as follows, &amp;c....
A long speech is given to <span class='sc'>Mackintosh</span>, who, under the name of <em>Macfungus</em>,
after a fervid sketch of the Temple of Freedom which he proposes to construct
on the ruins of ancient establishments, proceeds with kindling animation,
&amp;c....<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c024'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“The wit and fun of these imitations are undeniable, and their injustice is
equally so. <span class='sc'>Erskine</span>, with all his egotism, was, and remains, the greatest of
English advocates. He stemmed and turned the tide which threatened to
sweep away the most valued of our free institutions in 1794; and (we say
with <span class='sc'>Lord Brougham</span>) ‘Before such a precious service as this, well may the
lustre of statesmen and orators grow pale’. <span class='sc'>Mackintosh</span> was pre-eminently
distinguished by the comprehensiveness and moderation of his views; nor could
any man be less disposed by temper, habits, or pursuits towards revolutionary
courses. His lectures on <cite>The Law of Nature and Nations</cite> were especially directed
against the new morality in general, and <span class='sc'>Godwin’s</span> <cite>Political Justice</cite> in particular.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At a long subsequent period (1807) <span class='sc'>Canning</span>, when attacked in Parliament
for his share in <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>, declared that ‘he felt no shame for its
character or principles, nor any other sorrow for the share he had had in it
than that which the imperfection of his pieces was calculated to inspire’. Still,
it is one of the inevitable inconveniences of a connection with the Press that
the best known writers should be made answerable for the errors of their
associates; and the license of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite> gave serious and well-founded
offence to many who shared its opinions and wished well to its professed object.
In <span class='sc'>Wilberforce’s</span> <cite>Diary</cite> for May 18, 1799, we find ‘<span class='sc'>Pitt</span>, <span class='sc'>Canning</span>, and <span class='sc'>Pepper
Arden</span> came in late to dinner. I attacked <span class='sc'>Canning</span> on indecency of <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite>.’
<span class='sc'>Coleridge</span>, in his <cite><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Biographia Literaria</span></cite>, complains bitterly of the
calumnious accounts given by <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite> of his early life, and asks with
reason, ‘Is it surprising that many good men remained longer than perhaps
they otherwise would have done adverse to a party which encouraged and
openly rewarded the authors of such atrocious calumnies?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Edmonds says that <span class='sc'>Pitt</span> got frightened, and that the publication was
discontinued at the suggestion of the Prime Minister. It is not unlikely that
<span class='sc'>Canning</span>, now a member of the House of Commons and Under-Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, found his connection with it embarrassing, as his
hopes rose and his political prospects expanded. Indeed, it may be questioned
whether a Parliamentary career can ever be united with that of the daily or
weekly journalist without compromising one or both. At all events, the
original <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite> closed with the number containing <cite>New Morality</cite>, and
<span class='sc'>Canning</span> had nothing to do with the <em>monthly review</em> started under the same
name.”</p>

Satires by the late <span class='sc'>Jas. Hannay</span>, in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, April, 1857.]</p>

<p class='c006'>“... In the case of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>, what are we to say? A hundred
opinions may be adopted respecting the French Revolution. Some hate it with
unmitigated hatred. Some regret it, but accept its consequences as beneficial
to mankind on the whole. Some cherish its memory as a new political revelation
of which they hope to see still further results. But a candid man of any
of these persuasions must remember that the aim of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite> was to
keep <em>Britain</em> from revolution during 1797–8. It was therefore necessary to fight
as our soldiers afterwards did in Spain—to wage such a <em>literary</em> war as suited
the agitated spirit of Europe. While we blame <span class='sc'>Canning</span>, therefore, for speaking
as he did of <span class='sc'>Madame Roland</span>, we must not forget the indecorum of her
Memoirs, or that it was from persons of her party that vile aspersions were cast
upon the character of <span class='sc'>Marie Antoinette</span>. There were men quite ready to
begin the same work over here that had been done in France, and that in a
spirit of vulgar imitation, and under quite different circumstances. They had
to be shot down like mad dogs; for a cur, though contemptible in ordinary
cases, becomes tragic when he has hydrophobia.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite> must be claimed an honour which can be claimed for
scarce one of the works we have passed under review. Let us waive the
question how much we may have owed it for helping to inspire that unity and
stout insular self-confidence which carried us through the great war,—whole
within and impervious without. Let us consider it only in a literary point of
view, and we shall find it enjoying the rare distinction that its best Satires live
in real popular remembrance. The <cite>Knife-Grinder</cite>, with his</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>is almost as widely known as our nursery rhymes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite> excels all similar works in popularity, and in the
eminence of its contributors, it also excels them in another important particular.
It contains on the whole a greater number of really good things than any one
of them. The <em>Loves of the Triangles</em>, in which,</p>

      <div class='line'>“‘Th’ obedient Pulley strong Mechanics ply,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wanton Optics roll the melting eye!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>is an irresistible parody, and likely to keep the original of Darwin [<cite>Loves of the
Plants</cite>] in remembrance. Gray’s Odes have survived the burlesques of Colman;
and the <cite>Country and City Mouse</cite> of Prior and Montague is neglected by nine-tenths
of those who read with admiration the <cite>Hind and the Panther</cite>. But
Darwin’s case is peculiar. Other poems live in spite of ridicule; and his <cite>Loves
of the Plants</cite> in consequence of it. The Attic salt of his enemies has preserved
his reputation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is always a purpose in <cite>The Anti-Jacobin’s</cite> view something more
important than the mere persiflage that teases individuals. Like the blade of
Damascus, which has a verse of the Koran engraved on it, its fine wit glitters
terribly in the cause of sacred tradition.”</p>

<p class='c006'>At a moment, when whatever may be the habits of
inquiry and the anxiety for information upon subjects
of public concern diffused among all ranks of people, the
vehicles of intelligence are already multiplied in a proportion
nearly equal to this encreased demand, and to
the encreased importance and variety of matter, some
apology may perhaps be necessary for the obtrusion of a
new Paper upon the World; and some account may
reasonably be expected of the views and principles on
which it founds its pretensions to notice, before it can
hope to make its way through the crowd of competitors
which have gotten the start of it in the race for public
favour.</p>

<p class='c009'>[As this <cite>Prospectus</cite> was written by <span class='sc'>Mr. Canning</span>, and it has been prefixed
only to the former edition of the <cite>Poetry</cite> by the present Editor, it is again considered
an interesting addition to the present one.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>The grounds upon which such pretensions have
usually been rested by those who have engaged in
undertakings of this kind, are accuracy, variety, and
priority of Intelligence, connections at home, correspondence
abroad, and, above all, a profession of
impartial and unprejudiced attention to all opinions,
and to all parties and descriptions of men.</p>

<p class='c007'>On none of these Topicks is it Our intention to enlarge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of Our means of information, and of the use which
We make of them, our readers will, after a very short
trial, be enabled to form their own opinion. And to
that trial We confidently commit ourselves: professing,
however, at the same time, that if the only advantage
which We were desirous of holding out to our Readers,
were that of having it in our power to apprize them an
hour or a day sooner than those Journals, which are
already in their hands, of any event however important—We
should bring to the undertaking much less anxiety
for success, and should state our claims on public attention
with much less boldness, than We are disposed to
do in the consciousness of higher purposes, and more
beneficial views.</p>

<p class='c007'>Novelty indeed We have to announce. For what so
new in the present state of the daily and weekly <span class='sc'>Press</span>
(We speak generally, though there are undoubtedly
exceptions which we may have occasion to point out
hereafter) as <span class='sc'>the Truth</span>? To this object alone it is
that Our labours are dedicated. It is the constant violation,
the disguise, the perversion of the Truth, whether
in narrative or in argument, that will form the principal
subject of our <span class='sc'>Weekly Examination</span>: and it is by a
diligent and faithful discharge of this duty—by detecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>falsehood, and rectifying error, by correcting misrepresentation,
and exposing and chastising malignity—that We
hope to deserve the reception which We solicit, and to
obtain not only the approbation of the Country to our
attempt, but its thanks for the motives which have given
birth to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are strong words. But We are conscious of
intending in earnest what they profess. How far the
execution of our purpose may correspond with the design,
it is for others to determine. It is ours to state that
design fairly, and in the spirit in which we conceive it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the utility of such a purpose, if even tolerably
executed, there can be little doubt, among those persons
(a very large part of the community) who must have
found themselves, during the course of the last few years,
perplexed by the multiplicity of contradictory accounts of
almost every material event that has occurred in that
eventful and tremendous period; and who must anxiously
have wished for some public channel of information on
which they could confidently rely for forming their
opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>But before We can expect sufficient credit from persons
of this description, to enable us to supply such a defect,
and to assume an office so important, it is natural that
they should require some profession of our principles as
well as of our purposes; in order that they may judge
not only of our ability to communicate the information
which We promise, but of our intention to inform them
aright.</p>

<p class='c007'>To that freedom from <em>partiality</em> and <em>prejudice</em>, of which
We have spoken above, by the profession of which so
many of our Contemporaries recommend themselves, We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>make little pretension—at least in the sense in which
those terms appear now too often to be used.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have not arrived (to our shame perhaps we avow
it) at that wild and unshackled freedom of thought,
which rejects all habit, all wisdom of former times, all
restraints of ancient usage, and of local attachment;
and which judges upon each subject, whether of politicks
or morals, as it arises, by lights entirely its own, without
reference to recognized principle, or established practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>We confess, whatever disgrace may attend such a confession,
that We have not so far gotten the better of the
influence of long habits and early education, not so far
imbibed that spirit of liberal indifference, of diffused and
comprehensive philanthropy, which distinguishes the
candid character of the present age, but that We have
our feelings, our preferences, and our affections, attaching
on particular places, manners, and institutions, and
even on particular portions of the human race.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be thought a narrow and illiberal distinction—but
We avow ourselves to be <em>partial</em> to the <span class='sc'>Country</span> <em>in
which we live</em>, notwithstanding the daily panegyricks
which we read and hear on the superior virtues and
endowments of its rival and hostile neighbours. We are
<em>prejudiced</em> in favour of <em>her</em> Establishments, civil and
religious; though without claiming for either that ideal
perfection, which modern philosophy professes to discover
in the other more luminous systems which are arising
on all sides of us.</p>

<p class='c007'>The safety and prosperity of <em>these kingdoms</em>, however
unimportant they may seem in abstract contemplation
when compared with the more extensive, more beautiful,
and more productive parts of the world, do yet excite in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>our minds a peculiar interest and anxiety; and will probably
continue to occupy a share of our attention by no
means justified by the proportional consequence which
speculative reasoners may think proper to assign to them
in the scale of the universe.</p>

<p class='c007'>We should be averse to hazarding the smallest part of
the practical happiness of <em>this Country</em>; though the
sacrifice should be recommended as necessary for accomplishing
throughout the world an uniform and beautiful
system of theoretical liberty: and We should at all times
exert our best endeavours for upholding its constitution,
even with all the human imperfections which may belong
to it, though We were assured that on its ruins might be
erected the only pillar that is yet wanting to complete
the “<em>most glorious fabrick which the Integrity and Wisdom
of man have raised since the Creation</em>”.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, as Philosopher <span class='sc'>Monge</span><a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c024'><sup>[6]</sup></a> avers, in his eloquent and
instructive address to the Directory, “<cite>The Government
of England and the French Republick cannot exist together</cite>,”
We do not hesitate in our choice; though well aware
that in that choice we may be much liable, in the opinion
of many critics of the present day, to the imputation of a
want of candour or of discernment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Admirers of military heroism, and dazzled by military
success in common with other men, We are yet even <em>here</em>
conscious of some qualification and distinction in our
feelings: We acknowledge ourselves apt to look with
more complacency on bravery and skill, when displayed
in the service of our Country, than when We see them
directed against its interests or its safety; and, however
equal the claims to admiration in either case may be, We
feel our hearts grow warmer at the recital of what has
been atchieved by <span class='sc'>Howe</span>, by <span class='sc'>Jervis</span>, or by <span class='sc'>Duncan</span>, than
at the “<em>glorious victory of Jemappe</em>,” or “<em>the immortal
battle of the bridge of Lodi</em>”.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <span class='sc'>Morals</span> We are equally old-fashioned. We have
not yet learned the modern refinement of referring in all
considerations upon human conduct, not to any settled
and preconceived principles of right and wrong, not to
any general and fundamental rules which experience, and
wisdom, and justice, and the common consent of mankind
have established, but to the internal admonitions of
every man’s judgment or conscience in his own particular
instance.</p>

<p class='c007'>We do not dissemble,—that We reverence <span class='sc'>Law</span>,—We
acknowledge <span class='sc'>Usage</span>,—We look even upon <span class='sc'>Prescription</span>
without hatred or horror. And we do not think these,
or any of them, less safe guides for the moral actions of
men, than that new and liberal system of <span class='sc'>Ethics</span>, whose
operation is not to bind but to loosen the bands of social
order; whose doctrine is formed not on a system of reciprocal
duties, but on the supposition of individual, independent,
and unconnected rights; which teaches that all
men are pretty equally honest, but that some have
different notions of honesty from others, and that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>most received notions are for the greater part the most
faulty.</p>

<p class='c007'>We do not subscribe to the opinion, that a sincere conviction
of the truth of no matter what principle, is a sufficient
defence for no matter what action; and that the
only business of moral enquiry with human conduct is to
ascertain that in each case the principle and the action
agree. We have not yet persuaded ourselves to think it
a sound, or a safe doctrine, that every man who can
divest himself of a moral sense in theory, has a right to
be with impunity and without disguise a scoundrel in
practice. It is not in our creed, that <span class='sc'>Atheism</span> is
as good a faith as <span class='sc'>Christianity</span>, provided it be professed
with equal sincerity; nor could We admit it
as an excuse for <span class='sc'>Murder</span>, that the murderer was in
his own mind conscientiously persuaded that the
murdered might for many good reasons be better out
of the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all these and the like principles, in one word, of
JACOBINISM in all its shapes, and in all its degrees,
political and moral, public and private, whether as it
openly threatens the subversion of States, or gradually
saps the foundations of domestic happiness, We are the
avowed, determined, and irreconcileable enemies. We
have no desire to divest ourselves of these inveterate
prejudices; but shall remain stubborn and incorrigible in
resisting every attempt which may be made either by
argument or (what is more in the charitable spirit of
modern reformers) by force, to convert us to a different
opinion.</p>

<p class='c006'>It remains only to speak of the details of our <span class='sc'>Plan</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>It is our intention to publish Weekly, during the Session
of Parliament, a Paper, containing,</p>

<p class='c007'>First, An Abstract of the important events of the
week, both at home and abroad.</p>

<p class='c007'>Secondly, Such Reflections as may naturally arise
out of them: and,</p>

<p class='c007'>Thirdly, A contradiction and confutation of the falsehoods
and misrepresentations concerning these events,
their causes, and their consequences, which may be found
in the Papers devoted to the cause of <span class='sc'>Sedition</span> and
<span class='sc'>Irreligion</span>, to the pay or principles of <span class='sc'>France</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>This last, as it is by far the most important, will in all
probability be the most copious of the three heads; and
is that to which, above all others, We wish to direct the
attention of our Readers.</p>

<p class='c007'>We propose diligently to collect, as far as the range of
our own daily reading will enable us, and We promise
willingly to receive, from whatever quarter they may
come, the several articles of this kind which require to
be thus contradicted or confuted; which will naturally
divide themselves into different classes, according to their
different degrees of stupidity or malignity.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are, for instance (to begin with those of the
highest order), the <span class='sc'>Lies</span> of the Week; the downright,
direct, unblushing falsehoods, which have no colour or
foundation whatever, and which must at the very moment
of their being written, have been known to the writer to
be wholly destitute of truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next in rank come <span class='sc'>Misrepresentations</span> which,
taking for their groundwork facts in substance true, do
so colour and distort them in description, as to take away
all semblance of their real nature and character.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Lastly, The most venial, though by no means the least
mischievous class, are <span class='sc'>Mistakes</span>; under which description
are included all those Hints, Conjectures, and Apprehensions,
those Anticipations of Sorrow and Deprecations
of Calamity, in which Writers who labour under
too great an anxiety for the Public Welfare are apt to
indulge; and which, when falsified by the event, they are
generally too much occupied to find leisure to retract or
disavow:—A trouble which We shall have great pleasure
in taking off these Gentlemen’s hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>To each of these several articles We shall carefully
affix the name and date of the Publication from which
We may take the liberty of borrowing it.</p>

<p class='c006'>With regard to the <span class='sc'>Proceedings in Parliament</span>,
We shall not fail to mark to Our Readers the progress of
the public business; though it does not enter into our
Plan to give a regular detail of the Debates: nor would
the limits of our Paper allow of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have a further reason for not occupying this province,
which will equally account for our determination,
not to receive Advertisements—our earnest desire not to
lessen the circulation of any existing Public Print.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is obvious upon every ground of fairness and of
policy, that We must entertain this desire very strongly
with regard to the respectable Papers which are directed
by principles and attachments like our own: an attachment
(We have no wish to disguise it) to the cause of a
<span class='sc'>Government</span>, with whose support, whose popularity and
consequent means of exertion, the circumstances of the
present times have essentially connected the existence of
<span class='sc'>this Country</span> as an independent Nation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>As little should we wish to circumscribe the sale of
those <span class='sc'>Journals</span>, upon whose errors or perverseness, upon
whose false statements and pernicious doctrines We
reckon for the main support, as they have been the
principal cause of our undertaking. These We would
entreat to proceed with fresh vigour and increased
activity. It is our wish to be seen together, and to be
compared with them. Every week of misrepresentation
will be followed by its weekly comment; and with this
corrective faithfully administered, the longest course of
<span class='sc'>Morning Chronicles</span> or <span class='sc'>Morning Posts</span>, of <span class='sc'>Stars</span> or
<span class='sc'>Couriers</span>, may become not only innocent but beneficial.</p>

<p class='c007'>With these views then We commence our undertaking.
Whatever may be the success or the merit of its execution
in our hands, the want of something like it has so long been
felt and deplored by all thinking and honest men, that
We cannot doubt of the approbation and encouragement
with which the attempt will be received.</p>

<p class='c007'>We claim the support, and We invite the assistance,
of <span class='fss'>ALL</span>, who think with US that the circumstances and
character of the age in which We live require every exertion
of every man, who loves his <span class='fss'>COUNTRY</span> in the old way,
in which till of late years the <span class='fss'>LOVE</span> of one’s <span class='fss'>COUNTRY</span> was
professed by most men, and by none disclaimed or
reviled; of <span class='fss'>ALL</span> who think that the <span class='sc'>Press</span> has been long
enough employed principally as an engine of destruction,
and who wish to see the experiment fairly tried whether
that engine, by which many of the States which surround
us have been overthrown, and others shaken to their

who look with respect to public honour, and with attachment

valuable, and who think them in danger; and who, while
they detest and despise the principles and the professors
of that <span class='fss'>NEW FAITH</span> by which the foundations of all those
blessings are threatened to be undermined, lament the
lukewarmness with which its propagation has hitherto
been resisted, and are anxious, while there is yet time,
to make every effort in the cause of their <span class='fss'>COUNTRY</span>.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nov. 20, 1797.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In our anxiety to provide for the amusement as well as
information of our readers, we have not omitted to
make all the inquiries in our power for ascertaining the
means of procuring poetical assistance. And it would
give us no small satisfaction to be able to report that we
had succeeded in this point precisely in the manner which
would best have suited our own taste and feelings, as
well as those which we wish to cultivate in our readers.</p>

<p class='c007'>But whether it be that good Morals, and what we
should call good Politics, are inconsistent with the spirit
of true Poetry—whether “<em>the Muses still with freedom
found</em>” have an aversion to <em>regular</em> governments, and
require a frame and system of protection less complicated
than king, lords, and commons:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Whether primordial <em>nonsense</em> springs to life<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c024'><sup>[7]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>In the wild war of <em>democratic</em> strife,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>and there only—or for whatever other reason it may be,
whether physical, or moral, or philosophical (which last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>is understood to mean something more than the other
two, though exactly <em>what</em>, it is difficult to say), we have
not been able to find one good and true Poet, of sound
principles and sober practice, upon whom we could rely
for furnishing us with a handsome quantity of sufficient
and approved verse—such verse as our readers might be
expected to get by heart, and to sing; as the worthy
philosopher <span class='sc'>Monge</span> describes the little children of Sparta
and Athens singing the songs of Freedom, in expectation
of the coming of <em>the Great Nation</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this difficulty we have had no choice but either to
provide no poetry at all—a shabby expedient—or to go
to the only market where it is to be had good and ready
made, that of the <em>Jacobins</em>—an expedient full of danger,
and not to be used but with the utmost caution and
delicacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this latter expedient, however, after mature
deliberation, we have determined to have recourse;
qualifying it at the same time with such precautions as
may conduce at once to the safety of our readers’
principles, and to the improvement of our own poetry.</p>

<p class='c007'>For this double purpose, we shall select from time to
time from among those effusions of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jacobin</span></i> Muse
which happen to fall in our way, such pieces as may
serve to illustrate some one of the principles on which
the poetical as well as the political doctrine of the <span class='sc'>New
School</span> is established—prefacing each of them, for our
readers’ sake, with a short disquisition on the particular
tenet intended to be enforced or insinuated in the production
before them—and accompanying it with an humble
effort of our own, in imitation of the poem itself, and in
further illustration of its principle.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>By these means, though we cannot hope to catch “<em>the
wood-notes wild</em>” of the Bards of Freedom, we may yet
acquire, by dint of repeating after them, a more complete
knowledge of the secret in which their greatness lies than
we could by mere prosaic admiration; and if we cannot
become poets ourselves, we at least shall have collected
the elements of a <em>Jacobin</em> Art of Poetry for the use of
those whose genius may be more capable of turning them
to advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>It might not be unamusing to trace the springs and
principles of this species of poetry, which are to be found,
some in the exaggeration, and others in the direct inversion
of the sentiments and passions which have in all
ages animated the breast of the favourite of the Muses,
and distinguished him from the “vulgar throng”.</p>

<p class='c007'>The poet in all ages has despised riches and grandeur.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Jacobin</em> poet improves this sentiment into a hatred
of the rich and the great.</p>

<p class='c007'>The poet of other times has been an enthusiast in the
love of his native soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Jacobin</em> poet rejects all restriction in his feelings.
<em>His</em> love is enlarged and expanded so as to comprehend
all human kind. The love of all human kind is without
doubt a noble passion: it can hardly be necessary to
mention that its operation extends to <em>freemen</em>, and them
only, all over the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old poet was a warrior, at least in imagination;
and sung the actions of the heroes of his country in
strains which “made Ambition Virtue,” and which overwhelmed
the horrors of war in its glory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Jacobin</em> poet would have no objection to sing
battles too—but <em>he</em> would take a distinction. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>prowess of Buonaparte, indeed, he might chant in his
loftiest strain of exultation. <em>There</em> we should find nothing
but trophies and triumphs and branches of laurel
and olive, phalanxes of Republicans shouting victory,
satellites of despotism biting the ground, and geniuses of
Liberty planting standards on mountain-tops.</p>

<p class='c007'>But let his own country triumph, or her allies obtain
an advantage: straightway the “beauteous face of war”
is changed; the “pride, pomp, and circumstance” of
victory are kept carefully out of sight, and we are
presented with nothing but contusions and amputations,
plundered peasants, and deserted looms. Our poet
points the thunder of his blank verse at the head of the
recruiting serjeant, or roars in dithyrambics against the
lieutenants of pressgangs.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it would be endless to chase the coy Muse of
<em>Jacobinism</em> through all her characters. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mille habet ornatus.</span></i>
The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mille decenter habet</span></i> is perhaps more questionable.
For in whatever disguise she appears, whether of
mirth or of melancholy, of piety or of tenderness; under
all disguises, like <em>Sir John Brute</em> in woman’s clothes, she
is betrayed by her drunken swagger and ruffian tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the poem which we have selected for the edification
of our readers and our own imitation this day, the
principles which are meant to be inculcated speak so
plainly for themselves, that they need no previous
introduction.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<span class='sc'>Henry Marten</span> was one of the most interesting and remarkable of the
Regicides, not only from his abilities and consistent honesty, but from the
elegance of his manners, his wit, and the fascinating gaiety of his conversation;
and, moreover, from his humane disposition and generosity to fallen foes.
His private life, however, was disgraced by the most reckless debauchery,
which might seem more appropriate in such libertines as Rochester and Sedley
than in a coadjutor of the strict Puritan party. But from a note in Grey’s
edition of <cite>Hudibras</cite>, pt. ii., ch. i., p. 313, it would appear that the general
opinion at that time was that profligacy of a pronounced character was indulged
in privately by more than a few of that sanctimonious sect.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was the son of Sir Henry Marten, LL.D., a loyal Judge of the
Admiralty. After receiving a learned education at Oxford, he entered one of
the Inns of Court, and travelled in France. Having a stake in Berkshire—for he
inherited a property of £3000 a year, besides several thousand pounds in money—he
was elected, 1640, one of the members for the county in the last two Parliaments
of King Charles I. His chief seat was at Becket, in the parish of Shrivenham.
He afterwards obtained a grant of £1000 a year to him and his heirs out
of the forfeited estates of the Duke of Buckingham. His early marriage with a
rich widow, selected by his father, but not affected by himself, also benefited
his finances.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the commencement of the Civil Wars he was a violent Republican;
and as early as 1643 openly expressed his opinion of the desirability of the
destruction of the King and his children, for which rather premature advice
he was expelled from<a id='t17'></a> the House of Commons, and underwent a short imprisonment
in the Tower. He was appointed by the House of Commons a Colonel of
Horse and Governor of Reading, but made less mark as a soldier than as a
rapacious spoiler of the adherents of the King, which earned him the opprobrious
nickname of “Plunder-master General”.</p>

<p class='c009'>Being empowered to dispose of the Regalia and royal trappings, he once
invested <span class='sc'>George Wither</span>—who had been made one of Cromwell’s Major-Generals—with
them, and so accoutred induced the old Poet to strut up and
down Westminster Abbey to the scandal of right-thinking people.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>To him also were referred the alterations in the public arms, the Great
Seal, and the legends upon the money. Upon the latter was a shield bearing
the cross of St. George, encircled by a palm and olive branch, and inscribed
<em>The Commonwealth of England</em>, and on the reverse, <em>God with us, 1648</em>; which
occasioned the remark “that God and the Commonwealth were not on the
same side”.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing apparently could damp the ill-timed jocosity too often prevalent in
those troublous times, for at <span class='sc'>Marten’s</span> trial, 16th October, 1660, Ewer, who
had been his servant, swore that “at the signing of the warrant for the
King’s execution he did see a pen in Mr. <span class='sc'>Cromwell’s</span> hand, and he marked
Mr. <span class='sc'>Marten</span> in the face with it, and Mr. <span class='sc'>Marten</span> did the like to him”. But
many of his excesses were condoned in the eyes of both his friends and enemies
by his generous and humane spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>D’Israeli</span>, in his <cite>Commentaries on the life and Reign of Charles I.</cite>, describes
the ingenious way in which <span class='sc'>Marten</span> saved the life of <span class='sc'>David Jenkins</span>, a loyal
and obstinate Welsh judge, who, when brought to the bar of the House of
Commons to answer for imprisoning several persons for bearing arms against
the King, peremptorily disowned their jurisdiction, and defied them in the
following bold terms: “‘But, Mr. Speaker, since you and this House have
renounced your allegiance to your Sovereign, and are become a den of thieves,
should I bow myself in this House of Rimmon the Lord would not pardon me’.
The whole House were electrified.... He was voted guilty of high treason
without any trial. The day of execution was then debated. <span class='sc'>Harry Marten</span>,
who had not yet spoken, rose, not to dissent from the vote of the House, he
observed, but he had something to say about the time of the execution.
‘Mr. Speaker,’ said he, ‘everyone must believe that this old gentleman here
is fully possessed in his head resolved to die a martyr in his cause, for otherwise
he would never have provoked the House by such biting expressions. If
you execute him, you do precisely that which he hopes for, and his execution
will have a great influence over the people, since he is condemned without a
jury. I therefore move that we should suspend the day of execution, and in
meantime force him to live in spite of his teeth.’ The drollery of the motion
put the House into better humour, and he was reprieved. After being kept in
various prisons for eleven years, he was released by Cromwell, and died in 1663,
aged eighty-one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Another instance may be given of <span class='sc'>Marten’s</span> felicitous humour and humane
temper. When the Commons had rid themselves of the Sovereign, <em>they voted
the Lords to be dangerous and useless</em>. But <span class='sc'>Marten</span> proposed an amendment in
their favour; namely, that <em>they were useless, but not dangerous</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>His speeches in the House were represented to have been not long, “but
wondrous poynant, pertinent, and witty. He was exceedingly apt in apt
instances; he alone hath sometimes turned the whole House.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He wrote several tracts on parliamentary subjects, and <cite>Verses on the Death
of his Nephew, Charles Edmonds, 7th July, 1661, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">æt.</span> 30</cite>. But the most amusing of
the publications bearing his name is one entitled <cite>Familiar Letters to his Lady of
Delight; also her kinde Returnes: with his Rivall R. Pettingall’s Heroicall Epistles</cite>.
Printed by Edmundus de Speciosâ Villâ [<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, <span class='sc'>Edmund Gayton</span>]. <cite><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Bellositi
Dobunorum</span></cite> [Oxford], 1662 and 1663, 4to. Another edition, with additions, appeared
in 1685. “These epistles,” says <span class='sc'>D’Israeli</span>, “paint to the life the loose habits
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">espiègleries</span></i> of this witty profligate; and I think they have been referred to
by some inconsiderate writers as a <em>genuine</em> correspondence.” They were probably
altogether concocted by <span class='sc'>Gayton</span>. He was severely attacked in various
scurrilous lampoons, some of which are printed among the <cite>Rump Songs</cite>, 1662.</p>

<p class='c009'>On his trial he was found guilty and sentenced to death; but the good
feeling created among many who had in his prosperous days enjoyed his
society and hospitality, and even among many of his former opponents by his
generous treatment of them when in danger, stood him in good stead, and it
was by a well-timed and humorous appeal to the Judges—such as he himself
might have used—that his life was saved. Henry, fourth Viscount <span class='sc'>Falkland</span>,
whose virtuous and heroic father fell at the first Battle of Newbury while
fighting for the King, said to the Judges: “Gentlemen, ye talk here of making
a <em>sacrifice</em>: it was old law that all sacrifices were to be without spot or blemish;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and now you are going to make an old rotten rascal a sacrifice”. This piece of
wit pleased his Judges, and his sentence was commuted to imprisonment for
life. He was confined in Chepstow Castle, Monmouthshire, for twenty years,
and died in September, 1680, aged seventy-eight.</p>

<p class='c009'>He must have felt some contrition for his vicious life, for some time before
his death he made this epitaph, by way of <em>acrostic</em>, on himself:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

<p class='c009'>“In Cromwell’s time <span class='sc'>Chepstow Castle</span> served as a place of imprisonment
for Jeremy Taylor; and, after the Restoration, it received a less illustrious
occupant in the person of <span class='sc'>Harry Marten</span>, the Regicide, whose imprisonment
here has attracted more than its share of notice in consequence of the foolish
lines written by <span class='sc'>Southey</span> in his days of republicanism and pantisocracy, but
which are as untrue in <em>fact</em> as they are mischievous in <em>sentiment</em>. As to the <em>fact</em>,
it is notorious that <span class='sc'>Marten</span>—at all events after the first few years of his
imprisonment—was little more than a prisoner on parole; allowed to visit the
neighbouring gentry, and occupying at Chepstow Castle, with his family and
servants, spacious and comfortable apartments in the tower which still bears
his name. As to the <em>sentiment</em>, the lines received their best antidote in the
clever parody of Canning and Frere in <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>.”—<cite>Annals of Chepstow

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the specimen of <span class='sc'>Jacobin Poetry</span> which we gave in
our last number was developed a principle, perhaps one
of the most universally recognised in the Jacobin creed;
namely, “that the animadversion of <em>human law</em> upon
<em>human actions</em> is for the most part nothing but <em>gross
oppression</em>; and that, in all cases of the administration of
<em>criminal justice</em>, the truly benevolent mind will consider
only the <em>severity of the punishment</em>, without any reference
to the <em>malignity of the crime</em>”. This principle has of late
years been laboured with extraordinary industry, and
brought forward in a variety of shapes, for the edification
of the public. It has been inculcated in bulky quartos,
and illustrated in popular novels. It remained only to
fit it with a poetical dress, which had been attempted in
the <span class='sc'>Inscription</span> for <span class='sc'>Chepstow Castle</span>, and which (we
flatter ourselves) was accomplished in that for <span class='sc'>Mrs.
Brownrigg’s Cell</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another principle, no less devoutly entertained, and no
less sedulously disseminated, is the <em>natural and eternal
warfare of the</em> <span class='fss'>POOR</span> <em>and the</em> <span class='fss'>RICH</span>. In those orders and
gradations of society, which are the natural result of the
original difference of talents and of industry among mankind,
the Jacobin sees nothing but a graduated scale of
violence and cruelty. He considers every rich man as
an oppressor, and every person in a lower situation as
the victim of avarice, and the slave of aristocratical
insolence and contempt. These truths he declares
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>loudly, not to excite compassion, or to soften the consciousness
of superiority in the higher, but for the purpose
of aggravating discontent in the inferior orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>A human being, in the lowest state of penury and distress,
is a treasure to the reasoner of this cast. He contemplates,
he examines, he turns him in every possible
light, with a view of extracting from the variety of his
wretchedness new topics of invective against the pride of
property. He, indeed (if he is a true Jacobin), refrains
from <em>relieving</em> the object of his compassionate contemplation;
as well knowing that every diminution from the
general mass of human misery must proportionably
diminish the force of his argument.</p>

<p class='c007'>This principle is treated at large by many authors. It
is versified in sonnets and elegies without end. We
trace it particularly in a poem by the same author
[<span class='sc'>Southey</span>] from whom we borrowed our former illustration
of the Jacobin doctrine of crimes and punishments.
In this poem, the pathos of the matter is not a little
relieved by the absurdity of the metre. We shall not
think it necessary to transcribe the whole of it, as our
imitation does not pretend to be so literal as in the last
instance, but merely aspires to convey some idea of the
manner and sentiment of the original. One stanza, however,

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>[The following <em>Lines</em> were written by an ardent reformer, <span class='sc'>W. Roscoe</span>, the
accomplished author of the “Life of Leo X.,” and other works, to commemorate
the taking of the Bastille (14th July, 1789), and the publication by the National
Assembly (on 20th August following) of the famous “Declaration of Rights”—a
manifesto which became the creed of the Revolution, and which promulgated,
as the basis of social government, the specious but impracticable doctrines of
<em>liberty</em>, <em>equality</em>, and <em>the sovereignty of the people</em> exercised by universal suffrage.
How the hopes and anticipations of moderate reformers, as embodied in these
lines, were falsified by the spoliations and massacres which rapidly followed
are but too well known.</p>

<p class='c009'>When, therefore, the <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite> was established to combat the principles
of the Revolution, these <em>Lines</em> were, for party purposes, maliciously referred to,
and significantly recommended to be “recited on the anniversary of the 14th
August”. To make this allusion more clear, it must be remembered that on the
10th August, 1792, after frightful massacres, the Hotel de Ville was seized and
the Tuileries stormed. On the 13th the king and family were imprisoned in the
Temple. His deposition, the dismissal of the Ministers, and the formation of a
National Convention, on more popular principles than the Legislative Assembly,
were decreed by the victors. On the 14th Le Brun became Minister for Foreign
Affairs, Danton for Justice, and Monge for Marine; while the Girondist Ministers,
Roland, Servan, and Clavière, resumed their former functions as Ministers
of the Interior, War, and Finance respectively.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Song, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Sainte Guillotine</span></cite>, was evidently written as a <em>Contrast</em>, and
not as a <em>Parody</em>—a few lines at the beginning only excepted, which serve as an
introduction to verses on another promised phase of the Revolution, the invasion
of England.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c009'>[The Account of what was “anticipated to take place at the <em>Meeting of the
Friends of Freedom</em>”—alluded to on page <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>—duly appeared in <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>,
but has never hitherto formed a part of the collection of its Poetry. As
it is marked by much ability, and has been often quoted, it appears to the
editor desirable to introduce some portion of it into the present edition of the
<em>Poetry</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c031'>MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.</h3>

<p class='c034'>The <em>House of Russell</em> being given, <span class='sc'>Lord John</span> and <span class='sc'>Lord William</span> both rose
at once.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Lord John</span> made a very neat, and <span class='sc'>Lord William</span> a very appropriate speech.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Alderman Coombe</span> made a very impressive speech.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mr. Tierney</span> made a very pointed speech.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mr. Grey</span> made a very fine speech. He described the ministers as “bold
bad men”—their measures he repeatedly declared to be not only “weak, but
wicked”.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mr. Byng</span> said a few words.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>General Tarleton</span> and the <em>Electors of Liverpool</em> being given, the General,
after an eulogium on Mr. Fox, begged to anticipate their favourite concluding
toast, and to give “<em>The Cause of Freedom all over the World</em>”. This toast unfortunately
gave rise to an altercation which threatened to disturb the harmony
of the evening. Olaudah Equiano, the African, and Henry Yorke, the mulatto,
insisted upon being heard; but as it appeared that they were entering upon a
subject which would have entirely altered the complexion of the Meeting, they
were, though not without some difficulty, withheld from proceeding further.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span><span class='sc'>Mr. Erskine</span> rose, in consequence of some allusions which had been made
to Trial by Jury. He professed himself to be highly flattered by the encomiums
which had been lavished upon him; at the same time he was conscious that he
could not, without some degree of reserve, consent to arrogate to himself those
qualities which the partiality of his friends had attributed to him. He had, on
former occasions, declared himself to be clothed with the infirmities of man’s
nature; and he now begged leave in all humility to reiterate that confession;
he should never cease to consider himself as a feeble, and with respect to the
extent of his faculties in many respects, a finite being—he had ever borne in
mind, and he hoped he should ever continue to bear in mind, those words of the
inspired Penman, “Thou hast made him less than the angels, to crown him
with glory and honour”. These lines were indeed applicable to the state of man
in general, but of no man more than himself; they appeared to him pointed and
personal, and little less than prophetic; they were always present to his mind;
he could wish to wear them in his breast as a sort of amulet against the enchantment
of public applause, and the witcheries of vanity and self-delusion;
yet if he were indeed possessed of those superhuman powers—all pretensions
to which he again begged leave most earnestly to disclaim—if he were endowed
with the eloquence of an angel, and with all those other faculties which we
attribute to angelic natures, it would be impossible for him to do justice to the
eloquence with which the Honourable Gentleman who opened the meeting had
defended the Cause of Freedom, identified as he conceived it to be with the
persons and government of the <span class='sc'>Directory</span>. In his present terrestrial state he
could only address it as a prayer to God and as counsel to Man that the words
which they had heard from that Honourable Gentleman might work inwardly
in their hearts, and in due time, produce the fruit of Liberty and Revolution.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had not the advantage of being personally acquainted with any of the
Gentlemen of the <span class='sc'>Directory</span>; he understood, however, that one of them (<span class='sc'>Mr.
Merlin</span>) previous to the last change, had stood in a situation similar to his own—he
was, in fact, nothing less than a leading Advocate and Barrister in the
midst of a free, powerful and enlightened people.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conduct of the <span class='sc'>Directory</span> with regard to the exiled Deputies had been
objected to by some persons on the score of a pretended rigour. For his part he
should only say that having been, as he had been, both a Soldier and a
Sailor, if it had been his fortune to have stood in either of those two relations
to the <span class='sc'>Directory</span>—as a Man and as a Major-General he should not have scrupled
to direct his artillery against the National Representation:—as a Naval Officer
he would undoubtedly have undertaken for the removal of the Exiled Deputies;
admitting the exigency, under all its relations, as it appeared to him to exist,
and the then circumstances of the times, with all their bearings and dependencies,
branching out into an infinity of collateral considerations, and involving
in each a variety of objects political, physical, and moral; and these
again under their distinct and separate heads, ramifying into endless subdivisions
which it was foreign to his purpose to consider.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having thus disposed of this part of his subject, <span class='sc'>Mr. Erskine</span> passed in a
strain of rapid and brilliant allusions over a variety of points characteristic of
the conduct and disposition of the present Ministry; Mr. Burke’s metaphor of
“the Swinish Multitude,” Mr. Reeves’ metaphor of the “Tree of Monarchy,”
“the Battle of Tranent,” “the March to Paris,” the phrase of “Acquitted
Felons,” and the exclamation of “Perish Commerce”—which last expression
he declared he should never cease to attribute to Mr. Windham; so long, at
least, as it should please the Sovereign Dispenser to continue to him the power
of utterance and the enjoyment of his present faculties. He condemned the expedition
to Quiberon, he regretted the “Fate of Messrs. Muir and Palmer,” he
exulted in the “Acquittal of Citizens Tooke, Hardy, Thelwall, Holcroft and
others,” and he blessed that Providence to which (as it had been originally
allotted to him (Mr. Erskine) the talents which had been exerted in their defence)
the preservation of those Citizens might perhaps be indirectly attributed.
He then descanted on the captivity of La Fayette, and the Dividend on the
Imperial Loan.</p>

<p class='c009'>After fully exhausting these subjects, <span class='sc'>Mr. Erskine</span> resumed a topic on which
he had only slightly glanced before. In a most delicate and sportive vein of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>humour he contended, that if the people were a Swinish Multitude, those who
represented them must necessarily be a Swinish Representation. It would be
in vain to attempt to do justice to the polite and easy pleasantry which pervaded
this part of <span class='sc'>Mr. Erskine’s</span> speech. Suffice it to say that the taste of the
Audience showed itself in complete unison with the genius of the Orator, and
the whole of this passage was crowned with loud and reiterated plaudits. After
a speech of unexampled exertion, <span class='sc'>Mr. Erskine</span> now began to enter much at
length into a recital of select passages from our most approved English authors,
concluding with a copious extract from the several Publications of the late <span class='sc'>Mr.
Burke</span>; but such were the variety and richness of his quotations which he continued
to an extent far exceeding the limits of this paper, that we found ourselves
under the necessity, either of considerably abridging our original matter,
or omitting them altogether, which latter alternative we adopted the more
readily as the greater part of these brilliant citations have already passed
through the ordeal of a public and patriotic auditory; and as there is every
probability that the circumstances of the times will again call them forth on
some future emergency.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mr. Erskine</span> concluded by recapitulating, in a strain of agonizing and impressive
eloquence, the several more prominent heads of his speech:—He had
been a Soldier and a Sailor, and had a son at Winchester school—He had been
called by Special Retainers, during the summer, into many different and distant
parts of the country—travelling chiefly in Post-chaises—He felt himself called
upon to declare that his poor faculties were at the service of his Country—of the
free and enlightened part of it at least—He stood here as a Man—He stood in
the Eye, indeed in the Hand of GOD—to whom (in the presence of the Company
and Waiters) he solemnly appealed—He was of Noble, perhaps, Royal Blood—He
had a house at Hampstead—was convinced of the necessity of a thorough
and radical Reform—His Pamphlet had gone through Thirty Editions—skipping
alternately the odd and even numbers—He loved the Constitution, to which
he would cling and grapple—And he was clothed with the infirmities of man’s
nature—He would apply to the present French Rulers (particularly <span class='sc'>Barras</span> and
<span class='sc'>Reubel</span>) the words of the poet:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Be to their Faults a little blind;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Be to their Virtues very kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Let all their ways be unconfin’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>“And clap the Padlock on their mind!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>And for these reasons, thanking the Gentlemen who had done him the honour
to drink his Health, he should propose “<span class='sc'>Merlin</span>, <em>the late Minister of Justice, and
Trial by Jury!</em>” <span class='sc'>Mr. Erskine</span> here concluded a speech which had occupied
the attention and excited the applause of his Audience during a space of little
less than three hours, allowing for about three quarters of an hour, which were
occupied by successive fits of fainting, between the principal subdivisions of
his discourse.—<span class='sc'>Mr. Erskine</span> descended from the Table, and was conveyed down
stairs by the assistance of his friends. On arriving at the corner of the Piazzas,
they were surprized by a very unexpected embarrassment. <span class='sc'>Mr. Erskine’s</span>
horses had been taken from the carriage, and a number of able Chairmen engaged
to supply their place; but these fellows having contrived to intoxicate
themselves with the money which the Coachman had advanced to them on
account, were become so restive and unruly, so exorbitant in their demands
(positively refusing to abide by their former engagement) that <span class='sc'>Mr. Erskine</span>
deemed it unsafe to trust himself in their hands, and determined to wait the
return of his own more tractable and less chargeable animals. This unpleasant
scene continued for above an hour.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mr. Sheridan’s</span> health was now drunk in his absence and received with an
appearance of general approbation;—when in the midst of the applause <span class='sc'>Mr.
Fox</span> arose, in apparent agitation, and directed the attention of the Company
to the rising, manly virtues of <span class='sc'>Mr. Macfungus</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mr. Macfungus</span> declared that to pretend he was not elated by the encomiums
with which <span class='sc'>Mr. Fox</span> had honoured him was an affectation which he
disdained;—such encomiums would ever form the proudest recompense of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>patriotic labours—he confessed they were cheering to him—he felt them warm at
his heart—and while a single fibre of his frame preserved its vibration, it would
throb in unison to the approbation of that Honourable Gentleman. The applause
of the Company was no less flattering to him—he felt his faculties invigorated
by it, and stimulated to the exertion of new energies in the race of mind. Every
other sensation was obliterated and absorbed by it; for the present, however,
he would endeavour to suppress his feelings, and concentre his energies for the
purpose of explaining to the Company why he assisted now for the first time at
the celebration of the Fifth Revolution which had been effected in regenerated
France. The various and extraordinary talents of the Right Hon. Gentleman—his
vehement and overpowering perception, his vigorous and splendid intuition
would for ever attract the admiration of all those who were in any degree endowed
with those faculties themselves or capable of estimating them in others;
as such, he had ever been among the most ardent admirers, and on many occasions,
among the most ardent supporters of the Right Hon. Gentleman—he
agreed with him in many points—in his general love of Liberty and Revolution;
in his execration of the War; in his detestation of Ministers; but he entertained
his doubts, and till those doubts were cleared up, he could not, consistently with
his principles, attend at the celebration of any Revolution whatever.</p>

<p class='c009'>These doubts, however, were now satisfactorily done away. A pledge had
been entered into for accomplishing an effectual radical Revolution; not for the
mere overthrow of the present System, nor for the establishment of any other
in its place; but for the effecting such a series of Revolutions as might be
sufficient for the establishment of a Free System.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mr. Macfungus</span> continued he was incapable of compromising with first
principles, of acquiescing in short-sighted temporary palliative expedients: if
such had been his temper he should assuredly have rested satisfied with the
pledge which that Right Hon. Gentleman had entered into about six months
ago on the subject of Parliamentary Reform, in which pledge he considered the
promise of that previous and preliminary Revolution, to which he had before
alluded, as essentially implicated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whenever this Reform takes place,” exclaimed <span class='sc'>Mr. Macfungus</span>, “the
present degraded and degrading system must fall into dissolution; it must sink
and perish with the corruptions which have supported it. The national
energies will awake, and shaking off their lethargy as their fetters drop from
them, they will follow the Angel of their Revolution, while the Genius of Freedom
soaring aloft beneath the orb of Gallic Illumination will brush away as
with the wing of an Eagle all the cobwebs of Aristocracy. But before the
Temple of Freedom can be erected in their place, the surface which they have
occupied must be smoothed and levelled—it must be cleared by repeated Revolutionary
Explosions from all the lumber and rubbish with which Aristocracy
and Fanaticism will endeavour to encumber it, and to impede the progress
of the holy work.—The sacred level, the symbol of Fraternal Equality, must be
passed over the whole.—The completion of the Edifice will indeed be the more
tardy, but it will not be the less durable for having been longer delayed—Cemented
with the blood of tyrants, and the tears of the Aristocracy, it will
rise a monument for the astonishment and veneration of future ages. The
remotest posterity, with our children yet unborn, and the most distant portions
of the Globe, will crowd around its Gates and demand admission into its
Sanctuary.—The Tree of Liberty will be planted in the midst of it, and its
branches will extend to the ends of the Earth, while the Friends of Freedom
meet and fraternize and amalgamate under its consolatory shade. There our
Infants shall be taught to lisp in tender accents the Revolutionary Hymn—there
with wreaths of myrtle, and oak, and poplar, and vine and olive and
cypress and ivy; with violets and roses and daffodils and dandelions in our
hands we will swear respect to childhood and manhood and old age, and
virginity and womanhood and widowhood; but above all to the Supreme Being.—There
we will decree and sanction the Immortality of the Soul.—There pillars
and obelisks, and arches and pyramids, will awaken the love of Glory and of
our Country.—There Painters and Statuaries, with their chisels and colours,
and Engravers with their engraving tools will perpetuate the interesting
features of our Revolutionary Heroes; while our Poets and Musicians, with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>honourable emulation, strive to immortalize their memory. Their bones will
be entombed in the Vault below, while their sacred Shades continue hovering
over our Heads—those venerated Manes which from time to time will require
to be appeased by the blood of the remaining Aristocrats.—Then Peace and
Freedom, and Fraternity and Equality will pervade the whole Earth—while the
Vows of Republicanism, the Alter of Patriotism, and the Revolutionary Pontiff,
with the thrilling volcanic Sympathies, whether of Holy Fury or of ardent Fraternal
Civism, uniting and identifying, produce as it were an electric Energy.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mr. Macfungus</span> here paused for a few moments, seemingly overpowered by
the excess of Sensibility, and the force of the ideas which he was labouring to
convey.—The whole Company appeared to sympathize with his unaffected emotions.
After a short interval, he recovered himself from a very impressive
silence, and continued as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“These prospects, Fellow-Citizens, may possibly be deferred. The Machiavelism
of Governments may for the time prevail, and this unnatural and
execrable contest may yet be prolonged; but the hour is not far distant;
Persecution will only serve to accelerate it, and the blood of Patriotism streaming
from the severing axe will call down vengeance on our oppressors in a voice
of Thunder. I expect the contest, and I am prepared for it.—I hope I shall
never shrink nor swerve nor start aside wherever duty and inclination may
place me. My services, my life itself, are at your disposal—Whether to act or to
suffer, I am yours—With <span class='sc'>Hampden</span> in the field, or with <span class='sc'>Sidney</span> on the scaffold.
My example may be more useful to you than my talents: and this head may
perhaps serve your cause more effectually, if placed on a pole on Temple Bar,
than if it was occupied in organizing your Committees, in preparing your Revolutionary
Explosions, and conducting your Correspondence.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mr. Macfungus</span> said he should give, as an unequivocal test of his sentiments,
“<span class='sc'>Buonaparte and a Radical Reform</span>”.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conclusion of <span class='sc'>Mr. Macfungus’s</span> speech was followed by a simultaneous
burst of rapturous approbation from every part of the room. The applause continued
for several minutes, during which <span class='sc'>Mr. Macfungus</span> repeatedly rose to
express his feelings.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conversation now became more mixed and animated; several excellent
Songs were sung, and Toasts drank, while the progressive and patriotic festivity
of the evening was heightened by the vocal powers of several of the most
popular Singers. A new Song written by Captain <span class='sc'>Morris</span> received its
sanction in the warmest expression of applause. The whole company joined
with enthusiasm in their old favourite Chorus of Bow! Wow!! Wow!!!]</p>

<p class='c009'>[<span class='sc'>Macfungus</span> stands for <span class='sc'>Sir James Mackintosh</span>, who, after studying
medicine in Edinburgh, settled in London, and wrote for the opposition newspapers,
particularly the <cite>Morning Post</cite>, Daniel Stuart, the proprietor, being his
father-in-law. The first work that brought him into notice was his <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vindiciæ
Gallicæ</span></cite> (1791), in reply to Burke’s <cite>Reflections</cite> on the French Revolution, which
splendid philippic it greatly surpassed in philosophic thought, sound feeling,
and common sense. It was enthusiastically received by the Liberal party,
whose leaders eagerly sought his acquaintance and co-operation; and when the
<em>Association of the Friends of the People</em> was formed, he was appointed Secretary.
His subsequent successful career as an Advocate, Indian Judge, Member of
Parliament, Minister under Lord Grey, and as an English historian, bore out
the promise of his youth. He was born in 1765 and died in 1832.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<div class='c033'>Dec. 18, 1797.</div>

<p class='c007'>We cannot enough congratulate ourselves on having
been so fortunate as to fall upon the curious specimens of
classical metre and correct sentiment which we have
made the subject of our late Jacobinical imitations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fashion of admiring and imitating these productions
has spread in a surprising degree. Even those who
sympathise with the principles of the writer selected as
our model, seem to have been struck with the ridicule of
his poetry.</p>

<p class='c007'>There appeared in the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite> of Monday a
<cite>Sapphic Ode</cite>, apparently written by a friend and associate
of our author, in which he is however travestied most
unmercifully. And to make the joke the more pointed,
the learned and judicious editor contrived to print the
ode <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></i>, without any order of lines, or division of
stanza; so that it was not discovered to be <em>verse</em> till the
next day, when it was explained in a hobbling <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">erratum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>We hardly know which to consider as the greater
object of compassion in this case—the original <em>Odist</em>,
thus parodied by his friend, or the mortified <em>Parodist</em>
thus mutilated by his printer. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et tu, Brute!</span></i>” has
probably been echoed from each of these worthies to his
murderer, in a tone that might melt the hardest heart to
pity.</p>

<p class='c007'>We cordially wish them joy of each other, and we
resign the modern <em>Lesbian lyre</em> into their hands without
envy or repining.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our author’s <span class='sc'>Dactylics</span> have produced a second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>imitation (conveyed to us from an unknown hand), with
which we take our leave of this species of poetry also.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>No. XI.</h2>
</div>

<div class='c033'>Jan. 22, 1798.</div>

<p class='c007'>We have said in another part of our paper of this day,
“that though we shall never begin an attack, we shall
always be prompt to repel it”.</p>

<p class='c007'>On this principle, we could not pass over in silence the
<span class='sc'>Epistle to the Editors of the</span> <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite>, which appeared
in the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite> of Wednesday, and from
which we have fortunately been furnished with a motto
for this day’s paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>We assure the author of the epistle, that the answer
which we have here the honour to address to him, contains
our genuine and undisguised sentiments upon the
merits of the poem.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our conjectures respecting the authors and abettors of
this performance may possibly be as vague and unfounded
as theirs are with regard to the <span class='sc'>Editors</span> of the <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite>.
We are sorry that we cannot satisfy their curiosity
upon this subject—but we have little anxiety for the gratification
of our own.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is hardly to be expected, that the character of the
epistle should be taken on trust from the editors of this
volume; it is thought best, therefore, to subjoin the
whole performance as it originally appeared—a mode of
hostility obviously the most fair, and in respect to the
combatants in the cause of Jacobinism, by much the
most effectual. They are always best opposed by the
arms which they themselves furnish. Jacobinism shines
by its own light.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>To the respectable names which the author of the following
address has thought proper to connect with the
“<span class='sc'>Anti-Jacobin</span>,” no apology is made for thus preserving
this otherwise perishable specimen of dulness and defamation.
He who has been reviled by the enemies of the
“<span class='sc'>Anti-Jacobin</span>,” must feel that principles are attributed
to him, of which he need not be ashamed: and when the
abuse is conveyed in such a strain of feebleness and folly,
he must see that those principles excite animosity only
in quarters of which he need not be afraid.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is only necessary to add, what is most conscientiously
the truth, that this production, such as it is, is <em>by far the
best</em> of all the attacks that the combined wits of the cause
have been able to muster against the <span class='sc'>“Anti-Jacobin”</span>.</p>

    <div>NOTES TO THE ODE TO LORD MOIRA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>[This Ode, written by <span class='sc'>George Ellis</span>, refers to the wish of a “Third Party”
in the House of Commons, who were dissatisfied with the conduct of the war,
the embarrassed state of the finances, and the alarming situation of the country,
to have an interview with <span class='sc'>Lord Moira</span>, with a view to effect a change of
Ministry. The following extracts from a letter from his Lordship to <span class='sc'>Col.
M‘Mahon</span>, dated June 15, 1797, will throw some light on this negotiation.
“They requested that I would endeavour, on the assurance of their support, to
form an administration, on the principle of excluding persons, who had on
either side made themselves obnoxious to the public. I strenuously recommended
them to form an alliance with <span class='sc'>Mr. Fox’s</span> party, that might be satisfactory
to themselves, and reduce to strict engagement the extent of the measures,
which <span class='sc'>Mr. Fox</span>, when brought into office by themselves, would propose.
Hitherto nobody has been designated to any particular office but <span class='sc'>Sir William
Pulteney</span>. The gentleman had said that he was the person whom they should
be most gratified in seeing <span class='sc'>Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>, and I had professed
to them and to him that there was not any person with whom I could
act more confidently. I added, the introduction of <span class='sc'>Lord Thurlow, Sir W.
Pulteney</span>, and myself, into the Cabinet, would not assure the public of a
change of system.”—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c007'>The following Ode[A] was dropped into the letterbox in
our Publisher’s window. From its title—“<span class='sc'>A Bit of an
Ode to Mr. Fox</span>”—we were led to imagine there was
some mistake in the business, and that it was meant
to have been conveyed to Mr. Wright’s neighbour, Mr.
Debrett, whom we recollected to have been the Publisher
of the “Half of a Letter” to the same gentleman, which
occasioned so much noise (of horse-laughing) in the world.
Our politics certainly do not entitle us to the honourable
distinction of being made the channel for communicating
such a production to the public. But, for our parts, as
we are “not at war with genius,” on whatever side we
find it, we are happy to give this Poem the earliest place
in our Paper; and shall be equally ready to pay the same
attention to any future favours of the same kind, and
from the same quarter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Poem is a free translation, or rather, perhaps,
imitation, of the twentieth Ode of the second Book of
<span class='sc'>Horace</span>. We have taken the liberty to subjoin the passages
of which the parallel is the most striking.</p>

<p class='c009'>[The charge of <span class='sc'>Fox’s</span> having sent <span class='sc'>Adair</span> to St. Petersburg, to counteract
the measures of <span class='sc'>Pitt’s</span> government, first broached in Mr. Burke’s “Letter on
the Conduct of the Minority,” has been vigorously contradicted, yet so late as
April, 1854, it was alluded to as a fact by Lord Malmesbury in the House of
Peers. It was, however, on this occasion again authoritatively denied by <span class='sc'>Lord
Campbell</span>, who took occasion to observe that <span class='sc'>Sir Robert Adair</span> was “now in
his 90th year, and for many years had served his country with great assiduity
and fidelity. He had been sent by successive ministers [Mr. Fox, Lord Grey,
<em>Mr. Canning</em> (who assisted in libelling him so often in the pages of the present
work), Lord Wellesley, Lord Palmerston, the Duke of Wellington] to Vienna,
to Constantinople, to Brussels, and to Berlin, and had represented the Crown
of England upon some occasions of very great importance, in which he had uniformly
acquitted himself to the satisfaction of the Government and for the
benefit of his country. He believed a more honourable man had not lived in
this country at any time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The following denial by Sir Robert Adair himself is copied from his autograph
statement, prefixed to the <cite>Life of Wilberforce</cite>, published in 1838:—“This
idle story is here accredited by Mr. Wilberforce, and inserted by his sons,
without due examination. It was grounded on a journey I made to Vienna and
St. Petersburg in 1791. Doctor Prettyman [<em>sic</em>], Bishop of Winchester, in a
work entitled <cite>The Life of the Right Hon. William Pitt</cite>, published by him in 1823,
brought forward the fact of my having gone upon this journey as a criminal
charge against Mr. Fox, who, as he pretends, sent me upon it with the intent
of counteracting some negociations then carrying on between Great Britain and
Russia at St. Petersburg. I answered his accusation, I trust successfully, in
two letters published by Longman &amp; Co. [<cite>Two Letters from Mr. Adair to the
Bp. of Winchester, in answer to the charge of a High Treasonable Misdemeanour
brought by his Lordship against Mr. Fox and himself in his Life of the Rt. Hon. W.
Pitt</cite>, 8vo., 1821], and explained the circumstances which induced me in my
travels in 1791 to visit the two capitals above mentioned.—<span class='sc'>Robert Adair</span>:
1838.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>The “Mission” was, however, firmly believed in, and <span class='sc'>Pitt</span> was urged, but
in vain, by the Duke of Richmond and others of the Government, to arrest <span class='sc'>Fox</span>
for high treason.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following extract from the <cite>Political Memoranda of Francis, fifth Duke of
Leeds, now first printed from the Originals in the British Museum; edited by Oscar
Browning, for the Camden Society</cite>, 1884, is an illustration of the rumours current
at the time, and many years after.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saty. 24 Novr. 1792. <span class='sc'>Lord St. Helens</span> dined with me. After the Ladies
were gone upstairs we conversed, for some time on Foreign affairs.... Speaking
of the Russian business of last year he reprobated in the strongest terms
the conduct of <span class='sc'>Fox</span> in sending an agent, <span class='sc'>Mr. Adair</span>, to Petersburg to counteract
the negociations of this Court at that of Russia. He told me he knew for
certain that <span class='sc'>Mr. Adair</span> had shewn to some English merchants at Petersburg
the Empress’ Picture set in diamonds which had been given to him. That it
was not one of the sort usually given, but of much greater value, being set
round with large Brilliants, and the whole Picture covered with a Table
Diamond instead of Chrystal. That this was a present seldom made but on
some very particular occasion or to some great favorite (I remember to have
seen such a one in the possession of P. Orlow). <span class='sc'>Ld. St. H.</span> thought it must
have been worth six or seven thousand pounds, and of too much value probably
to have been meant for <span class='sc'>Mr. Adair</span>. The conclusion we both very naturally
drew from this circumstance was not very favorable to <span class='sc'>Mr. Fox</span>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The following additional particulars relating to the connection between
<span class='sc'>Fox</span> and <span class='sc'>Adair</span> may not be thought out of place here. They are extracted
from the highly interesting and important <cite>Croker Papers, being the Correspondence
and Diaries, 1809–1830, of the Rt. Hon.</cite> <span class='sc'>J. W. Croker</span>, <cite>M.P., Edited by Louis J.
Jennings. M.P.</cite>, 3 vols., 8vo., 1884.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first is in these terms: “When <span class='sc'>Adair</span>, whose father was a surgeon,
went as <span class='sc'>Fox’s</span> Ambassador to Russia, <span class='sc'>Lord Whitworth</span>, then the King’s
Minister, made a good joke, which tended not a little to lower <span class='sc'>Adair</span>, and
defeat his object. ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Est-ce un homme très considérable, ce M. d’Adair?</span>’
asked the <span class='sc'>Empress</span>. ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pas trop, Madame</span>,’ replied Lord Whitworth, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quoique
son père était grand seigneur [saigneur]</span>.’” The other is taken from a very long
statement on various matters, made by K. George IV., when Prince of Wales,
to Croker personally. Adair’s wife, the Prince said, was a Frenchwoman with
whom <span class='sc'>Andreossi</span>, when here as Buonaparte’s Minister, intrigued. <span class='sc'>The Duchess
of Devonshire</span> told him—the Prince of Wales—that Mrs. Adair had offered
her a bribe of £10,000 down, and as much more whenever she might want it,
if she would communicate the Cabinet secrets, with which the French thought
she could not fail to be acquainted, through her intimacy with all the leaders
of the Government. This caused a breach between <span class='sc'>Fox</span> and <span class='sc'>Adair</span>. But the
former could only tell <span class='sc'>Adair</span> that an obstacle—which he could neither reveal
nor overcome, but which did not affect or alter <span class='sc'>Fox’s</span> personal regard for him—prevented
his appointment to be <span class='sc'>Fox’s</span> Under-Secretary of State.—<cite>Croker
Papers</cite>, i. 293.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c009'>[The following account of the celebration of <span class='sc'>Fox’s</span> Birth-day, printed in the
<cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite>, has not hitherto appeared in the editions of the <cite>Poetry</cite>. <cite>The Song
by Mr. Fox</cite> refers to the Subscription raised, after a meeting at the Crown and
Anchor, in the summer of 1793, for relieving him in his then present need, and
purchasing an Annuity for him. A Caricature by <span class='sc'>Gillray</span> on this meeting
was published on the 12th June, 1793.</p>

<h3 class='c031'>MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.</h3>

<p class='c034'>The public, distracted with the various accounts of the celebration of Mr.
Fox’s Birth-day, naturally turn to us for an authentic detail of that important
event—from a recollection of the correct and impartial statement we gave in a
former Number, of what passed at a <span class='sc'>Meeting of the Friends of Freedom</span>
[page 32].</p>

<p class='c009'>To justify their confidence, we have had recourse to the <cite>Morning Post</cite> and
<cite>Morning Chronicle</cite> (the <cite>Courier</cite> being too stupid for our purpose), whose statements
we have carefully read, and corrected from the information of several
gentlemen who were present. We are thus enabled to lay before our readers a
genuine narrative of the whole proceeding, which we defy the tongue of Slander
to controvert in any material point.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Mr. Fox’s reputation had been for some time on the decline, it was
thought necessary by the party (who are in great want of a <em>Head</em>) to make as
respectable an appearance as possible on the present occasion. It was therefore
suggested (at a previous meeting of confidential friends) that if the unfortunate
shyness which subsisted between the <em>Whig Club</em> and the <em>Corresponding Society</em>
could be opportunely removed by a few unimportant concessions on the part of
the former, such a number of citizens might be readily procured from that
respectable body as would serve to give the day an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i> it had not experienced
since the fatal schism of 1792.</p>

<p class='c009'>This hint, so reasonable in itself, was immediately adopted, and Sir <span class='sc'>Francis
Burdett</span>, who was well acquainted with their haunts, was ordered into the
neighbourhood of Smithfield with a competent number of tickets. He was on
the point of setting out, when the Editor of the <cite>Morning Post</cite> observed, that
<em>forgery</em><a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c024'><sup>[106]</sup></a> was so common at present, that he hardly thought it prudent to admit
all who might come with a bit of scribbled paper: on this it was determined to
distribute the price of admission amongst a certain number of people to be
selected by the Envoy:—these, it was rightly concluded, would not fail to
appear, from motives of vanity, as they could have no other possible chance of
dining with the Premier Dupe, we would say Duke, in England. It now remained
to determine the sum: this, after a short discussion, was fixed at Eight
Shillings and Sixpence per head, “which,” said the Editor of the <cite>Morning Post</cite>,
“will shew we cannot he persons of mean rank, since we can afford, in hard
times, to give so much for a dinner”;<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c024'><sup>[107]</sup></a> and Citizen <span class='sc'>Bosville</span> was desired to
advance the money upon the credit of the Whig Fund.</p>

<p class='c009'>Previous to the meeting, the chairman dispatched a note to Sir <span class='sc'>William
Addington</span>, requesting that the Crown and Anchor might be exempted from
the visitation of his runners during the morning of the 24th [Jan., 1798]. To
this Sir <span class='sc'>William</span> assented, on condition that it should be recommended to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>gentlemen, to leave their pocket-books and watches at home, that there might
be as little temptation as possible to break the peace. Thus everything was
arranged with a precaution that seemed to set accident at defiance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before four o’clock the passage to the <span class='fss'>LARGE ROOM</span> was crammed, when,
on a hint that dinner was on the point of being served, one of the head waiters
advanced to the great door, and opened a wicket for the admission of the company,
as fast as they paid down their money. Two or three had already passed
in good order, when Mr. John Nicholls advanced, and instead of 8s. 6d., produced
to the astonished receiver, <em>seventeen</em> of his <span class='fss'>PRINTED SPEECHES</span>, which, valuing
them at sixpence a-piece, he contended would make up the sum required.
These “<em>assets</em>” however, were absolutely rejected; and a violent dispute was
on the point of commencing, when Sir <span class='sc'>Christopher Hawkins</span> stept forward,
and whispering a few words, which we did not hear, obtained leave for his
friend to pass. The Speeches were therefore deposited, and Mr. <span class='sc'>Nicholls</span> was
already got within the wicket, when the man suddenly pulled him back by the
coat, and the dispute recommenced with more violence than ever. Upon inquiry
into the cause of this new tumult, we found that a wag (whom we afterwards
discovered to be Mr. <span class='sc'>Jekyll</span>) had played the member for Tregony a trick;
having taken an opportunity, in the crowd, of extracting the <em>genuine</em> speeches
from the pocket of the Honourable Member, and replacing them by the same
number of the <em>spurious</em> ones, printed for Mr. <span class='sc'>Wright</span>, the publisher of this
Paper. These the waiter very properly refused to receive, alleging, and indeed
truly, that instead of <em>six</em> pence a-piece, the whole seventeen were not worth <em>six</em>
farthings.</p>

<p class='c009'>This altercation continued so long, that the company grew impatient; and
Mr. <span class='sc'>Bryan Edwards</span>, a little ashamed of his friend, who still continued obstinate,
offered to furnish his quota. Harmony now seemed to be restored, when
all at once a cry of astonishment broke forth that beggars all description. On
putting his hand into his pocket for the price of admission, Mr. E. suddenly
turned pale, and exclaimed, “by G—, gentlemen, some of you have picked my
pockets!” A hundred voices instantly repeated the same cry, and a dreadful
scene of confusion and uproar took place.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ardebant cuncta et fracta compage ruebant.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>What the consequence would have been, it is impossible to say, had not the
waiter, with an air of authority, commanded the doors to be shut at each end of
the passage, and every man to exhibit the contents of his pocket. A faint cry of
No! No! was over-ruled; and Sir <span class='sc'>Francis Burdett</span> produced an old Red Cap
from the bosom of his shirt, which he put into the hands of the Duke of <span class='sc'>Bedford</span>,
who was appointed collector-general <em>by acclamation</em>. With this his Grace went,
from man to man, executing his duty with the utmost fairness and impartiality;
and when he had finished, poured out the contents of the cap before them all.
These, it must be confessed, were a little heterogeneous, consisting, besides a
large sum of money, of a brass knocker (this was immediately claimed by the
landlord), a pewter pot squeezed together, a pair of pattens, a pint decanter, a
duck ready trussed for dressing, a great quantity of potatoes, and a vinegar
cruet. What was most extraordinary was, that though, as his Grace afterwards
declared, the money was found in very unequal portions, yet the total sum,
which was £222, 5s. 6d., being divided among the company, amounting to 523
persons, produced 8s. 6d. for each individual, with the exception of the <em>Member</em>
for <em>Tregony</em>, who brought nothing but his speech, and Capt. <span class='sc'>Morris</span>, who pays
for everything with a Song.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing material occurred during the Dinner, which was allowed to be excellent
of its kind, and where no such dish as Cow-heel (as maliciously reported
in <cite>The True Briton</cite>) made its appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the cloth was removed, the Duke of <span class='sc'>Norfolk</span> took the Chair
amidst repeated plaudits,<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c024'><sup>[108]</sup></a> and addressed the Company in these words:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Three virtuous Men, Citizens, have stood up in defence of Liberty—<span class='sc'>Maximilian
Robespierre</span>, <span class='sc'>Collot D’Herbois</span>, and <span class='sc'>Charles James Fox</span>:—The first
is guillotined; the second transported to <em>Cayenne</em>; and the third”——Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>all eyes were immediately upon Mr. <span class='sc'>Fox</span>, who now entered the room, supported
by Citizens <span class='sc'>John Gale Jones</span> and <span class='sc'>John Horne Tooke</span>—“As the Right
Hon. Gentleman (resumed the Duke, a little peevishly) has mistaken his cue,
and appeared sooner than he ought, I shall spare his modesty the panegyric I
was preparing, and shortly conclude with proposing the health of <span class='sc'>Charles
James Fox</span>.”—This was drank with three times three.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the clamour had subsided, Mr. <span class='sc'>Fox</span> arose and said, “That
language, at least any which he could boast, was inadequate to the exquisite
feelings of gratitude which at once delighted and oppressed him, at the sight
of so numerous and so respectable a body of free and independent Citizens,
met for a purpose which would make this the proudest and the happiest day of
his life”. Having dwelt a little on this idea, Mr. <span class='sc'>Fox</span> observed, “that he would
not interrupt the conviviality of the day by a long Speech: he knew there were
several present who came to hear him make a long Speech, but he would not
make a long Speech—to what purpose should he do it?—what could he add to
the Speech lately delivered by him, and so faithfully recorded in the <span class='sc'>Anti-Jacobin</span>,
a contemptible Publication, but one to which the praise of Accuracy
could not be denied. The new and extraordinary circumstances of the times
called for new and extraordinary measures: he would, therefore, if they pleased,
compress what he had to say into a <em>Song</em>—(<em>loud applauses</em>)—One word only.—He
owed both the <em>burden</em> and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">idea</span></i> of this Song to the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>. He
had yesterday, the 23rd, found there <span class='sc'>A begging Address</span> to the Nation, with
<span class='sc'>Date Obolum Belisario</span> prefixed to it as a Motto. This had pleased him
much, and this morning at breakfast he had endeavoured to adapt it, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutatis
mutandis</span></i>, to his own circumstances: he should now have the honour of
giving it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We know not how far Mr. <span class='sc'>Fox</span> might have proceeded, had he not been interrupted
by a jangling of bells from the Side-table which immediately drew all
eyes that way. This proceeded from Capt. <span class='sc'>Morris</span>, who had fallen asleep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>during Mr. <span class='sc'>Fox’s</span> Song, and was now nodding on his chair, with a large paper
Cap on his head, ornamented with gilt tassels and bells, which one of the
company had dexterously whipped on unperceived. The first motion was that
of indignation; but the stupid stare of the unconscious Captain, who half
opened his eyes at every sound of the bells as his head rose or fell, and immediately
closed them again, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">somno vinoque gravatus</span></i>, had such a powerful effect
on the risible faculties of the Company, that they broke, as if by consent, into
the most violent and convulsive fits of laughter; Mr. <span class='sc'>Fox</span> himself not being
exempt from the general contagion.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the Captain was made sensible of the cause of this uproar, he
attempted to pull off the Cap, but was prevented by a Citizen from the <em>Corresponding
Society</em>, who maintained that the Company had a right to be amused
by the Captain in what manner they pleased; and that, as he seemed to amuse
them more effectually in <em>that state</em> than in any other, he insisted, for one, on his
continuing to wear the Cap. This was universally agreed to, with the exception
of the Duke of <span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>. The Captain was therefore led to the upper table,
with all his “jangling honours loud upon him!” Here, as soon as he was
seated, his Noble Friend called upon him for a Song.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain sang the “<span class='sc'>Plenipo</span>” in his best manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was received with great applause; and then the Duke gave “The
Defenders—of Ireland”—(<em>three times three</em>).</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain <span class='sc'>Morris</span> then began</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And all the Books of Moses”;—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>but was interrupted, before he had finished the first line, by Mr. <span class='sc'>Tierney</span>, who
declared he would not sit there and hear anything like ridicule on the Bible.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c024'><sup>[110]</sup></a>—(<em>Much
coughing and scraping</em>.)—Mr. Erskine took God to witness, that he thought
the Captain meant no harm;—and a gentleman from Cambridge, whose name
we could not learn, said, with great <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i>, that it was no more than was done
every day by his acquaintance. Mr. <span class='sc'>Tierney</span>, however, persisted in his opposition
to the Song, and Captain <span class='sc'>Morris</span> was obliged to substitute “Jenny Sutton”
in the place of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the good humour of the company was already broken in upon, and Mr.
<span class='sc'>Tierney</span> soon after left the room (to which he did not return) with greater marks
of displeasure in his face than we ever remember to have seen there.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Duke now gave <span class='sc'>Radical Reform</span> (<em>three times three, followed by continued
shouts of applause</em>).</p>

<p class='c009'>A Counsellor <span class='sc'>Jackson</span> attempted to sing “Paddy Whack,” but was soon
silenced, on account of his stupid perversion of the words, and his bad voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Citizen <span class='sc'>Gale Jones</span> then rose and said—that he was no Orator, though he
got his living by oratory, being Chairman of a Debating Society. He had also
written a book—which he was told had some merit. He did not rise to recommend
it, but he thought it right to <em>hint</em>, that those who wished for Constitutional
information might be supplied with it at the Bar; the price was trifling—Eighteen-pence
was nothing to the majority of the Company;—to himself,
indeed—(here Mr. <span class='sc'>Horne Tooke</span> called out Order! Order! with some marks of
impatience)—He begged pardon, he would say no more—there was no one whom
he valued like Mr. <span class='sc'>Tooke</span>, there was no one indeed to whom he was under such
obligations; the very shoes he had on were charged by Citizen <span class='sc'>Hardy</span> to Mr.
<span class='sc'>Tooke’s</span> account—Mr. <span class='sc'>Tooke</span> was also a great friend to a Radical Reform—he
loved a Radical Reform himself; the Poor must always love Radical Reforms—he
should therefore beg leave to propose the health of Mr. <span class='sc'>John Horne Tooke</span>.—(<em>Three
times three.</em>)</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Tooke</span> rose, and spoke nearly as follows: “You all know, Citizens, in
what detestation I once held the Man whose Birth-day we are now met to
commemorate. You cannot yet have forgot the ‘<span class='sc'>Two Pair of Portraits</span>’ I
formerly published, nor the glaring light in which I hung up him and his
father to the execration of an indignant posterity. You must also be apprized
of the charges of Corruption, Insurrection, and Murder (<em>much hissing and applause,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the latter predominant</em>) which I brought against him, justly, as I must still think,
at a former Election for Westminster. How happens it then, you will say, that I
now come forward to do him honour? I will tell you. At the last Election for
Westminster, I had still my suspicions of his sincerity; he appeared too anxious
to preserve measures with the spruce and powdered Aristocrats who usually
attended him to the Hustings; nor was it till the fourth or fifth day before the
close of the Poll, that those suspicions were removed. Aware that he was
losing ground among the People, he determined to make one great effort to
re-establish his popularity. He therefore came forward, and addressed the
free and independent Electors in front of the Hustings, in a Speech, of which
the remembrance yet warms my heart. From that moment, I marked him as
my own! Retractation was impossible; and the panegyric he lately delivered
on a Radical Reform, in a House which I despise too much to name, was the
natural and inevitable consequence of that day’s declaration. You may remember,
that when I addressed my Friends, I only said, ‘Gentlemen, Mr. <span class='sc'>Fox</span> has
spoken my sentiments; he has even gone beyond them—but I thank him’.—What
I then said I now repeat, with regard to his Speech on a late occasion—‘<span class='sc'>I
am most perfectly satisfied with his conduct; nor do I wish to
advance one step in the cause of reform, beyond what Mr. Fox has
pledged himself to go!!!</span>’”<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c024'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Tooke</span> then begged leave to propose Mr. <span class='sc'>Fox’s</span> health for the second
time, and sat down amidst a thunder of applause.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c024'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The Duke of <span class='sc'>Norfolk</span> observed to the Company, that as they had drunk the
health of a Man dear to the People, he would now call upon them to drink the
health of their Sovereign<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c024'><sup>[113]</sup></a>—here a hiccup interrupted his Grace, and a most violent
cry of “No Sovereign! no Sovereign!” resounded through the room, and continued
for several minutes, notwithstanding the earnest entreaties of the Duke to
be heard. Order was, however, restored at length, when his Grace gently chid
the Company for taking advantage of a slight infirmity of nature, to impute a
design to him which was wholly foreign from his heart—(<em>loud applause</em>). He
augured well, however, of their patriotism, and would now afford them an opportunity
of repairing the injury they had done him, by giving the Toast as he
intended—“<span class='sc'>The Health of our Sovereign—the Majesty of the People</span>”.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c024'><sup>[114]</sup></a>—(<em>Loud
and incessant shouts of applause.</em>)</p>

<p class='c009'>A disgusting scene of uproar and confusion followed, which we shall not
attempt to detail. The Chairman sank under the table in a state of stupefaction,
and the rest of the Company, maddened alike with noise and wine, committed
a thousand outrages, till they were literally turned into the streets by the
Waiters. As many of them as could speak were conducted home by the watchmen;
others were conveyed “in silent majesty” to the Round-house; and not
a few of them slept out the remainder of the night upon the steps of the neighbouring
houses. The Reporters of the Jacobin Papers were sought out, and
conveyed home by the pressmen, devils, &amp;c., and one poor youth, whom we afterwards
found to be a Writer in the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite> (hired for the day by <cite>The
True Briton</cite>)<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c024'><sup>[115]</sup></a> had his pockets picked of a clean white Handkerchief and a
Notebook, after being severely beaten for deserting his former Employers.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Whether primordial motion sprang to life</div>

      <div class='line'>Mechanic nature goes her endless round:</div>
      <div class='line'>Or ever varying, acts but to fulfil</div>
      <div class='line'>The sovereign mandates of Almighty will;—</div>
      <div class='line'>Let learned folly seek, or foolish pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rash in presumptuous ignorance, decide.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>[Eminent as Richard Payne Knight was as a classical scholar and archæologist,
his poetical powers were not highly appreciated by his literary contemporaries,
as is amusingly shown in a letter from Horace Walpole, dated 22nd
March, 1796, to the Rev. W. Mason, in which he declares how much he is
“offended and disgusted by Mr. Knight’s new, insolent, and self-conceited
poem”. He winds up thus: “I send you a parody on two lines of Mr. Knight,
which will show you that his poem is seen in its true light by a young man of
allowed parts, <span class='sc'>Mr. Canning</span>, whom I never saw. The originals are the two
first lines at the top of page <a href='#Page_5'>5</a>:”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Some fainter irritations seem to feel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which o’er its languid fibres gently steal”.—<span class='sc'>Knight.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Cools the crimp’d cod, to pond-perch pangs imparts,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thrills the shelled shrimps, and opens oysters’ hearts.”—<span class='sc'>Canning.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>It is evident from this that Canning had thought of parodying the poem immediately
after its publication, and that Walpole had seen a specimen in manuscript,
nearly two years before its publication in the <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite>, in which the
two lines (28, 29) are thus altered:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Cools the crimpt cod, fierce pangs to perch imparts,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shrinks shrivell’d shrimps, but opens oysters’ hearts”.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>By an oversight, Peter Cunningham, in his edition of Walpole’s Letters, attributes
the latter’s attack to a previous production of Knight’s, published in
1794, entitled <cite>The Landscape: a didactic Poem in three Books</cite>, a work which had
excited Walpole’s high indignation by expressing opinions opposed to his
own.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c007'>The specimen of the poem on the “Progress of Man,”
with which we favoured our Readers in our last Number,
has occasioned a variety of letters, which we confess have
not a little surprised us, from the unfounded, and even
contradictory charges they contain. In one, we are
accused of Malevolence, in bringing back to notice a
work that had been quietly consigned to oblivion;—in
another, of Plagiarism, in copying its most beautiful
passages;—in a third, of Vanity, in striving to imitate
what was in itself inimitable, &amp;c., &amp;c. But why this
alarm? has the author of the “<cite>Progress of Civil Society</cite>”
an exclusive patent for fabricating <em>Didactic</em> poems? or
can we not write against Order and Government without
incurring the guilt of Imitation? We trust we were not
so ignorant of the nature of a didactic poem (so called
from <em>didaskein</em>, to teach, and <em>poema</em>, a poem; because it
teaches nothing, and is not poetical) even before the
<cite>“Progress of Civil Society”</cite> appeared, but that we were
capable of such an undertaking.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall only say further, that we do not intend to
proceed regularly with our Poem; but having the remaining
thirty-nine Cantos by us, shall content ourselves
with giving, from time to time, such extracts as may
happen to suit our purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following passage, which, as the reader will see
by turning to the Contents prefixed to the head of the
Poem, is part of the First Canto, contains so happy a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>deduction of <span class='sc'>Man’s</span> present state of Depravity, from
the first slips and failings of his Original State, and
inculcates so forcibly the mischievous consequences of
<em>social</em> or <em>civilized</em>, as opposed to <em>natural</em> society, that
no dread of imputed imitation can prevent us from giving
it to our readers.</p>

lately taught Cupid and recollect in its stead only what
Cupid taught me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>[The preceding Ode, written in the character of Charles Howard, eleventh
<span class='sc'>Duke of Norfolk</span>, refers to the famous toast, “Our Sovereign’s health—<span class='sc'>the
Majesty of the People</span>,” proposed by his Grace at a Banquet at the “Crown
and Anchor Tavern,” Strand, on the 24th January, 1798, given to celebrate the
birth-day of <span class='sc'>C. J. Fox</span>. For this toast and other sentiments promulgated at
the meeting, his Grace a few days after received notice of his dismissal from
the Lord-Lieutenancy of the West Riding of Yorkshire and his Colonelcy in
the Militia, and on the 6th of February Earl Fitzwilliam was gazetted to the
former office, vice the Duke of Norfolk, <em>resigned</em>. But sixteen years earlier, this
<em>Toast</em> was not considered seditious; for in the <cite>General Advertiser</cite> of the 13th of
April, 1782, then edited by Perry (afterwards the eminent proprietor of the
<cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>), we find an account of a dinner of the electors of Westminster
held the preceding day at the Shakespeare Tavern, <em>Earl Fitzwilliam</em> in the
chair. The first toast given by his Lordship was, “<span class='sc'>The Majesty of the
People</span>”. It was drunk by the Earl of Effingham, the Earl of Surrey (afterwards
Duke of Norfolk, and the subject of the present remarks), Mr. Secretary
Fox, Burke, Windham, Dean Jebb, J. Churchill, Brand Hollis, Dr. Brocklesby,
&amp;c. Thus the identical toast was proposed and drunk by the Earl of Fitzwilliam,
to whom the Lord-Lieutenancy now taken from the Duke of Norfolk
was given. It is not a little remarkable that Lord Fitzwilliam himself was
dismissed by his new Tory allies, Oct. 23, 1819, from the same Lord-Lieutenancy
of the West Riding of Yorkshire, having signed the requisition for the York
meeting, at which resolutions were passed condemning the measures of Ministers
(Lords Liverpool, Eldon, Bathurst, Castlereagh, Palmerston, &amp;c.), respecting
the Manchester Reform Meeting, called by Henry Hunt, on 16th August, at
which occurred what is known as the “Peterloo Massacre”.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The company was a very large one, but the estimated number of 2000 diners
is surely an error. The Duke of Norfolk presided, supported by the Duke of
Bedford, the Earls of Lauderdale and Oxford, Sheridan, Tierney, Erskine,
Capt. Morris (who produced three new songs for the occasion), and Horne
Tooke; the latter became reconciled to Fox by the explanation the latter gave
of his sentiments on parliamentary reform. On the cloth being removed, he
rose and said, “We are met in a moment of most serious difficulty to celebrate
the birth of a man dear to the friend of freedom. I shall only recall to your
memory that not twenty years ago, the illustrious <span class='sc'>George Washington</span>
had not more than two thousand men to rally round him when his country
was attacked. America is now free. This day full two thousand men are
assembled in this place. I leave the application to you. I propose to you the
health of <span class='sc'>Charles James Fox</span>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the course of the evening the Duke’s health was drunk with great enthusiasm.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>He returned thanks, and concluded his speech with these words,
“Give me leave to call on you to drink, Our Sovereign’s health,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>The Majesty of the People</span>”.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>After this toast had been drunk and warmly applauded, the Duke gave successively,
“The Rights of the People,” “Constitutional Redress of the Wrongs of the
People,” “A speedy and effectual Reform in the Representation of the People
in Parliament,” “The genuine Principles of the British Constitution,” “The
People of Ireland, and may they be speedily restored to the Blessings of Law
and Liberty”.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 6th of February, the next monthly meeting of the <em>Whig Club</em> was held
at the London Tavern, Ludgate Hill. The <span class='sc'>Duke of Norfolk</span> presided. He
gave as a toast, “The Man who dares be honest in the worst of times—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Charles James Fox</span>”.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Fox</span> returned thanks, and then toasted</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>The Sovereignty of the People</span>”.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He subsequently proposed the health of the Duke of Norfolk in a most
powerful speech. He adverted to the dismissal of the <span class='sc'>Duke</span>. “No reason had
been officially assigned; it was, however, generally understood that it had arisen
from the eulogium pronounced on <span class='sc'>General Washington</span>. Was it to be
wondered at, that the noble Duke, who had uniformly opposed the American
war, should have done so? What Englishman, what man of any country, whose
heart was animated with a love of freedom, did not venerate the name of that
illustrious patriot? It seems also “a toast” has given offence—the Majesty of
the People. I do not know upon what times we are fallen, but the sovereignty
of the people of Great Britain is surely a thing not new to the language, to the
feelings, nor the hearts of Englishmen. It is the basis of the whole system of
our Government. It is an opinion, which if it be not true, King William was
an usurper. By what right did the glorious and immortal King William the
Third, whose portrait is placed on our chair, come to the throne of these realms,
if not by that of the sovereignty of the people?... The King holds his
title by an Act of Parliament. Who called that Parliament? King William
the Third. By what right did he obtain it? By a Convention representing the
sovereignty of the people. The Convention of Representatives in fact did the
thing. It is whimsical enough to deprive the noble Duke of his appointments for
an offence which, if he had not committed during the reigns of George I. and
George II., would have subjected him to the charge of being a Jacobite, and an
adherent of the exiled family.... Of the persons of his Majesty’s Ministers
I will not say a word. There are several of them to whom I may fairly say this
sentiment is not new. One member of the Cabinet (the Duke of Portland) is
still a member of this club; another (Mr. Windham) was a member; and a
third (Earl Spencer) long gloried in holding the same tenets. How often with
the two first have we drunk the sentiment in this room! What did they mean
when they drank the Sovereignty of the People? What, but that they recognised
by this approved and customary method a truth which belongs to all
people in reality, but is the avowed basis of the Government of England, that
the people of every country are its legitimate Sovereign, and that all authority
is delegated from and for them? I should be ashamed, on account of my old
respect for those persons, if they did not honestly avow this to be their sense of
the sentiment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While adverting, on this occasion, to the dismissal of the <span class='sc'>Duke of Norfolk</span>
from his Lord-Lieutenancy and Colonelcy of Militia, <span class='sc'>Fox</span> remarked, “I have
nothing the Ministers can take from me. I am still indeed a Privy Councillor,
at least I know nothing to the contrary; and if this sentiment entitles the
Noble Duke to this animadversion, I shall certainly feel that I am equally
entitled to this mark of his Majesty’s displeasure.” This anticipation was
verified shortly afterwards.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 1st of May following, at the Freemasons’ Tavern, another dinner of
the <em>Whig Club</em> took place. <span class='sc'>Fox</span> was in the chair, and gave, as the first toast—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>The Sovereignty of the People of Great Britain</span>”.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>The Duke of Norfolk proposed “The Health of the Man who dares be
Honest in the worst of Times—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Charles James Fox</span>”.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Fox</span> responded in a most impressive speech. He said: “On any other occasion,
he should have contented himself with returning thanks, but in the very
peculiar embarrassments in which the country was now plunged, he thought it
necessary to say a few words in the only place in which he thought it might be
useful for him to deliver his sentiments. The circumstances and events of
public affairs of late had induced him and many of his friends to abstain from
their usual assiduous attendance in Parliament. Their exertions for the preservation
of the Constitution had been of no avail; two years ago they had seen
the repeal of the Bill of Rights carried by a triumphant majority; they had
seen the functions of the Constitutional Law suspended, on alarm created by
the Ministers themselves; and however well-founded the alarm might now be,
he scorned the idea that it was necessary for him to attend in his place in the
House of Commons, for the purpose only of vindicating himself from the vulgar
calumny that he was not an enemy to a foreign invasion. It would be an insult
on his whole life if such a declaration could be expected from him. He believed
there was not a voice in the assembly he addressed which was not in unison
with his own—namely, that every man who heard him was both ready and
willing to stand forth in defence of his country, with the spirit that belongs to
Englishmen. He found no fault with those who thought it necessary to make
these professions elsewhere. Thus much only would he say in this place for
himself. <em>The present Government of the country, he had no hesitation in saying, was
a Government of Tyranny. They had adopted the principles of Robespierre, and their
object was to establish tyranny in England.</em> Look at the situation of the Sister
Kingdom; our own will soon be the same. He had no remedy to recommend
but that the friends of freedom should be united and firm, and wait for better
times. Tyranny was now the order of the day in every country in Europe.
Notwithstanding the arbitrary proceedings of our own Ministers, he was persuaded
the unanimous feeling of the country, the universal determination of
every man in it was to be ready to take the field against a foreign foe; and,
indeed, they had a powerful motive to do so, for if they were united, they had
a better chance to get rid of the tyranny of their own Ministers than they could
possibly have by the success of a foreign invasion. Even in his present retirement
he should be ready to come forward, in every constitutional effort, to regain
our lost liberties; and he should be in the foremost of the ranks to repel
the invasion of a daring enemy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This speech led to a most important consequence—the erasing from the
Privy Council Book the name of one of the most illustrious statesmen which
had ever adorned it. <span class='sc'>Fox’s</span> name was struck out by the King on the 9th of
May.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 6th of June, after the dinner at the <em>Whig Club</em>, the <span class='sc'>Duke of Bedford</span>
proposed “<span class='sc'>The Health of Charles Fox</span>,” and remarked in severe terms on
Ministers having caused the King to strike his name out of the list of the Privy
Council. <span class='sc'>Fox</span> said: “It would be most unfit for him to say a word respecting
the Noble Duke’s allusion to a circumstance personal to himself. Would to God
the time of the Ministers had been always employed in such <em>frivolous fooleries</em> as
settling who should be <em>Honourable</em> and who <em>Right Honourable</em>, and deliberating
on the titles most befitting their friends and supporters.” <span class='sc'>Fox</span>, with some of
his supporters, seceded from Parliament in 1797, and returned to the House of
Commons in 1802 to defend the Peace of Amiens, and he was persuaded to continue
his parliamentary attendance by the urgent request of friends, with whose
wishes he felt himself bound to comply.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<div class='c033'>April 2, 1798.</div>

<p class='c007'>We promised in our Sixteenth Number, that though
we should not proceed regularly with the publication
of the Didactic Poem, the <span class='sc'>Progress of Man</span>,—a work
which, indeed, both from its bulk, and from the erudite
nature of the subject, would hardly suit with the purposes
of a Weekly Paper,—we should, nevertheless,
give from time to time such extracts from it as we
thought were likely to be useful to our readers, and
as were in any degree connected with the topics or
events of the times.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following extract is from the 23rd Canto of this
admirable and instructive Poem;—in which the author
(whom, by a series of accidents, which we have neither
the space, nor indeed the liberty, to enumerate at
present, we have discovered to be <span class='sc'>Mr. Higgins</span>, of
<em>St. Mary Axe</em>) describes the vicious refinement of what
is called civilized society, in respect to marriage; contends
with infinite spirit and philosophy against the
factitious sacredness and indissolubility of that institution;
and paints in glowing colours the happiness and
utility (in a moral as well as political view) of an arrangement
of an opposite sort, such as prevails in
countries which are yet under the influence of pure
and unsophisticated nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>In illustration of his principles upon this subject, the
author alludes to a popular production of the German
Drama, the title of which is the “<span class='sc'>Reformed Housekeeper</span>”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>[<cite>The Stranger</cite>], which he expresses a hope of
seeing transfused into the language of this country.</p>

      <div class='line in2'>While mutual wishes form love’s only vows,</div>
      <div class='line'>By mutual interests nursed, the union grows;</div>
      <div class='line'>Respectful fear its rising power maintains,</div>

<p class='c009'>In illustration of these peculiar doctrines of Love and Marriage, the authors
of the present Parody introduced into the first twenty lines of the preceding
“Extract,” the very free statements on these subjects which appear in Chapters
8, 12, 14, 16, 17, of the narrative of Cook’s First Voyage to the Pacific in the
“Endeavour,” in 1768, derived, by the editor, Dr. John Hawkesworth, from the
Diary of Mr. (afterwards Sir Joseph) Banks, who accompanied Captain Cook.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c009'>[<span class='sc'>Lord Erskine</span>, after dinner, inveighed bitterly against Marriage; and
smarting, I suppose, under the recollection of his own unsuccessful choice, concluded
by saying that a wife was <em>a tin canister tied to a man’s tail</em>, which very
much excited the indignation of Lady Ann Culling Smith, who was of the
party. “Monk” Lewis took a sheet of paper, and wrote the following neat
epigram on the subject, which he presented to Her Royal Highness [the Duchess
of York]:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

      <div class='line'>And the fair Lady Ann, while the subject he carries on,</div>
      <div class='line'>Feels hurt at his Lordship’s degrading comparison.</div>
      <div class='line'>But wherefore degrading? if taken aright,</div>
      <div class='line'>A tin canister’s useful, and polished, and bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>And if dirt its original purity hide,</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>[<span class='sc'>Richard Payne Knight</span>, eminent as he was as a classical scholar and
archæologist, was  not successful as a poet or moralist, and this is shown in an
amusing manner in a letter from Horace Walpole to the Rev. W. Mason, dated
22nd March, 1796, in which he declares how much he is offended and disgusted
by Knight’s “<em>new</em> insolent and self-conceited poem,” alluding to his <cite>Progress of
Civil Society</cite>,—the former one being “<cite>The Landscape</cite>, a didactic poem in three
books,” 4to, pub. 1794, of which mention has already been made.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1816 he was examined before a Select Committee of the House of Commons
on the proposed purchase by the Government of the Elgin Marbles; but his
estimate of their value as works of the highest art was much below that of other
artistic witnesses, such as Flaxman, Westmacott, Chantrey, B. West, and others.
For these statements he was severely criticised in vol. 14 of the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>,
and in a squib, reprinted in the <cite>New Whig Guide</cite> in 1819. He valued the collection
at £25,000; Gavin Hamilton’s estimate was £60,800, and Lord Aberdeen’s
£35,000; for which latter sum they were obtained by the Government. He
bequeathed his collection of ancient Bronzes, Greek Coins, &amp;c.—valued at
£50,000—to the British Museum.</p>

<p class='c009'>He represented Ludlow till 1806. He was a supporter of <span class='sc'>Fox</span>, upon whom
he wrote a Monody. He was never married, and he was succeeded in his fine
property, including Downton Castle, near Ludlow, &amp;c., on his death in 1824,
by his brother, Thomas Andrew Knight, one of the most scientific of horticulturists,
and he in turn was succeeded by his grandson, Andrew Johnes Rouse
Boughton, second son of the late Sir W. E. Rouse Boughton, Bart., who added
by royal license in 1856 the name of Knight to his patronymic.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c009'>[The drama (here nicknamed <cite>The Reformed Housekeeper</cite>), but entitled by the

Sheridan being then lessee, as “<cite>The Stranger</cite>,” on the 24th March, 1798. The
following was the cast:—<em>The Stranger</em>, J. P. Kemble; <em>Baron Steinfort</em>, John
Palmer; <em>Francis</em>, R. Palmer; <em>Peter</em>, Suett; <em>Tobias</em>, J. Aikin; <em>Solomon</em>, Wewitzer;
<em>Count Wintersen</em>, Barrymore; <em>Mrs. Haller</em>, Mrs. Siddons; <em>Countess Wintersen</em>,
Mrs. Goodall; <em>Charlotte</em>, Miss Stuart. It was considered by competent
authorities as one of Kemble’s finest efforts, and was performed on twenty-six
successive nights. Some of our most eminent actors and actresses have essayed
the principal parts. Miss O’Neill made her last appearance on the stage in the
character of Mrs. Haller, 13th of July, 1818.</p>

<p class='c009'>The acting version purported to be altered from the German by Benj.
Thompson (afterwards Count Rumford), but it is likely that all or most of
the alterations came from the skilful hands of Sheridan, assisted by Kemble.
The pathetic song introduced, “<em>I have a silent sorrow here</em>,” was written
by the former. Two other versions of the drama appeared in the year
1798—one by A. Schinck, and the other by G. Papendick—but neither has
been acted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kotzebue tells us in his <cite>Autobiography</cite> that this play of his was acted at the
Imperial Palace of <em>The Hermitage</em>, St. Petersburg, under his superintendence
while manager of the Imperial Company of German Comedians, and excited
visible emotion in the Emperor Paul. He himself saw it acted at Tobolsk
during his exile in Siberia. The vast and splendid palace of <em>The Hermitage</em>
is now given up to the Arts. It contains the enormous collection of Pictures
accumulated by the Russian sovereigns (including the Houghton Gallery formed
by Sir Robert Walpole), together with a Gallery of Sculpture, one of the finest
assortments of Antique Gems in the world, a museum of Grecian and Etruscan
Antiquities, and a library of rare Books and Manuscripts.</p>

<p class='c009'>An awful event took place during the performance of this play a short time
after its production. John Palmer, an eminent comedian, while acting the
principal character, at Liverpool, on the 2nd of August, 1798, expired on the
stage. He had recently suffered severe domestic bereavements, which are supposed
to have given a painful application to some passages in the third act in
which he had to utter the words: “There is another and a better world”. In
the first scene of the fourth act, his agitation increased; he fell into the arms of
the performer of the part of Baron Steinfort, and died without a groan. A narrative
of this shocking event, published immediately afterwards, by the same
performer, disposes of the generally-received but more emotional tradition that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Palmer’s earthly career was terminated while pronouncing the above words.
He was in his fifty-seventh year.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is not the only instance of so impressive an end, for a similar death-stroke
overtook Joseph Peterson, an excellent actor, in October, 1758, while representing
<em>The Duke</em> in <cite>Measure for Measure</cite>. In act 3, sc. 1, in reciting the
words—</p>

<p class='c009'>[“One other noted character we visited—the one who, according to William
Taylor of Norwich, was the greatest of all. This was <span class='sc'>August von Kotzebue</span>,
the very popular dramatist, whose singular fate it was to live at variance with
the great poets of his country, while he was the idol of the mob. He was at one
time (about this time (1801) and a little later) a favourite in all Europe. One of
his plays, <cite>The Stranger</cite>, I have seen acted in German, English, Spanish, French,
and, I believe, also Italian. He was the pensioner of Prussia, Austria, and
Russia. The odium produced by this circumstance, and the imputation of being
a spy, are assigned as the cause of his assassination by [C. L. Sand] a student
of Jena, a few years after our visit [March 3, 1819]. He was living, like Goethe,
in a large house and in style. I drank tea with him, and found him a lively
little man, with small black eyes. He had the manners of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit-maître</span></i>.”—<cite>Crabb

</div>

<div class='c033'>April 16, 1798.</div>

<p class='c007'>We cannot better explain to our readers the design
of the poem from which the following extracts are
taken, than by borrowing the expressions of the author,
Mr. <span class='sc'>Higgins</span>, of <em>St. Mary Axe</em>, in the letter which accompanied
the manuscript.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must premise, that we had found ourselves called
upon to remonstrate with Mr. H. on the freedom of
some of the positions laid down in his other didactic
poem, the “Progress of Man”; and had in the course
of our remonstrance hinted something to the disadvantage
of the <em>new principles</em> which are now afloat in the
world, and which are, in our opinion, working so much
prejudice to the happiness of mankind. To this Mr. H.
takes occasion to reply—<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c024'><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“What you call the <em>new principles</em> are, in fact, nothing
less than <em>new</em>. They are the principles of primeval nature,
the system of original and unadulterated man.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“If you mean by my addiction to <em>new principles</em> that
the object which I have in view in my larger work
[meaning the ‘Progress of Man’] and in the several
other <em>concomitant</em> and <em>subsidiary</em> didactic poems which are
necessary to complete my plan, is to restore this first,
and pure simplicity; to rescue and to recover the interesting
nakedness of human nature, by ridding her
of the cumbrous establishments which the folly, and
pride, and self-interest of the worst part of our species
have heaped upon her;—you are right. Such is my
object. I do not disavow it. Nor is it mine alone.
There are abundance of abler hands at work upon it.
<em>Encyclopedias</em>, <em>Treatises</em>, <em>Novels</em>, <em>Magazines</em>, <em>Reviews</em>, and
<em>New Annual Registers</em>, have, as you are well aware,
done their part with activity and with effect. It remained
to bring the <em>heavy</em> artillery of a didactic poem
to bear upon the same object.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I have selected your paper as the channel for
conveying my labours to the public, it was not because
I was unaware of the hostility of your principles to
mine, of the bigotry of your attachment to ‘things as
they are,’ but because, I will fairly own, I found some
sort of cover and disguise necessary for securing the
favourable reception of my sentiments; the usual pretexts
of humanity, and philanthropy, and fine feeling,
by which we have for some time obtained a passport
to the hearts and understandings of men, being now
worn out or exploded. I could not choose but smile
at my success in the first instance, in inducing <em>you</em> to
adopt my poem as your own.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you have called for an explanation of these
principles of ours, and you have a right to obtain it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Our first principle is, then—the reverse of the trite
and dull maxim of Pope—‘<em>Whatever is, is right</em>’. We
contend, that ‘<em>Whatever is, is wrong</em>’; that institutions,
civil and religious, that social order (as it is called
in <em>your</em> cant) and regular government, and law, and I
know not what other fantastic inventions, are but so
many cramps and fetters on the free agency of man’s
<em>natural intellect</em> and <em>moral sensibility</em>; so many badges
of his degradation from the primal purity and excellence
of his nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our second principle is, the ‘<em>eternal and absolute
perfectibility of man</em>’. We contend, that if, as is demonstrable,
we have risen from a level with the <em>cabbages
of the field</em> to our present comparatively intelligent and
dignified state of existence, by the mere exertion of
our own <em>energies</em>; we should, if these <em>energies</em> were not repressed
and subdued by the operation of prejudice,
and folly, by <span class='sc'>King-Craft</span> and <span class='sc'>Priest-Craft</span>, and the
other evils incident to what is called civilized society,
continue to exert and expand ourselves in a proportion
infinitely greater than anything of which we yet have
any notion:—in a <em>ratio</em> hardly capable of being calculated
by any science of which we are now masters:
but which would in time raise man from his present
biped state to a rank more worthy of his endowments
and aspirations; to a rank in which he would be, as it
were, <em>all</em> <span class='sc'>Mind</span>; would enjoy unclouded perspicacity and
perpetual vitality; feed on <em>oxygene</em>, and never die, but
<em>by his own consent</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But though the poem of the <span class='sc'>Progress of Man</span>
alone would be sufficient to teach this system and
enforce these doctrines, the whole practical effect of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>them cannot be expected to be produced, but by the
gradual perfecting of each of the sublimer sciences;—at
the husk and shell of which we are now nibbling and
at the kernel whereof, in our present state, we cannot
hope to arrive. These several sciences will be the
subjects of the several <em>auxiliary</em> <span class='sc'>Didactic Poems</span> which
I have now in hand (one of which, entitled <span class='sc'>The Loves
of the Triangles</span>, I herewith transmit to you), and for
the better arrangement and execution of which, I
beseech you to direct your bookseller to furnish me with
a handsome Chambers’s Dictionary; in order that I may
be enabled to go through the several articles alphabetically,
beginning with <em>Abracadabra</em>, under the first letter,
and going down to <em>Zodiac</em>, which is to be found under
the last.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am persuaded that there is no science, however
abstruse, nay, no trade or manufacture, which may not
be taught by a didactic poem. In that before you, an
attempt is made (not unsuccessfully, I hope) to <em>enlist the
imagination under the banners of Geometry</em>. <em>Botany</em> I found
done to my hands. And though the more rigid and unbending
stiffness of a mathematical subject does not
admit of the same appeals to the warmer passions,
which naturally arise out of the <em>sexual</em> (or, as I have
heard several worthy gentlewomen of my acquaintance,
who delight much in the poem to which I allude, term
it, by a slight misnomer no way difficult to be accounted
for—the <em>sensual</em>) system of Linnæus;—yet I trust that
the range and variety of illustration with which I have
endeavoured to ornament and enlighten the arid truths
of Euclid and Algebra, will be found to have smoothed
the road of Demonstration, to have softened the rugged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>features of Elementary Propositions, and, as it were, to
have strewed the <em>Asses’ Bridge</em> with flowers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such is the account which Mr. <span class='sc'>Higgins</span> gives of his
own undertaking, and of the motives which have led him
to it. For our parts, though we have not the same
sanguine persuasion of the <em>absolute perfectibility</em> of our
species, and are in truth liable to the imputation of being
more satisfied with <em>things as they are</em>, than Mr. <span class='sc'>Higgins</span>
and his associates;—yet, as we are, in at least the same
proportion, less convinced of the practical influence of
didactic poems, we apprehend little danger to our
readers’ morals from laying before them Mr. <span class='sc'>Higgins’s</span>
doctrine in its most fascinating shape. The poem
abounds, indeed, with beauties of the most striking kind,—various
and vivid imagery, bold and unsparing impersonifications;
and similitudes and illustrations brought
from the most ordinary and the most extraordinary
occurrences of nature—from history and fable—appealing
equally to the heart and to the understanding, and
calculated to make the subject of which the poem
professes to treat rather amusing than intelligible. We
shall be agreeably surprised to hear that it has assisted
any young student at either University in his mathematical
studies.</p>

<p class='c007'>We need hardly add, that the plates illustrative of this
poem (the engravings of which would have been too
expensive for our publication) are to be found in Euclid’s
Elements, and other books of a similar tendency.</p>

<p class='c043'>The frequent solicitations which we have received for
a continuation of the <span class='sc'>Loves of the Triangles</span> have
induced us to lay before the public (with Mr. Higgins’s
permission) the concluding lines of the Canto. The
catastrophe of Mr. and Mrs. Gingham, and the episode
of Hippona, contained, in our apprehension, several reflections
of too free a nature. The conspiracy of Parameter
and Abscissa against the Ordinate is written in a strain
of poetry so very splendid and dazzling as not to suit the
more tranquil majesty of diction which our readers
admire in Mr. Higgins. We have therefore begun our
extract with the Loves of the Giant Isosceles, and the
Picture of the Asses-Bridge, and its several illustrations.</p>

<p class='c009'>These poems, produced in that dreary time for English poetry which elapsed
between the disappearance of Cowper and Burns and the advent of Scott and
Byron, had, in spite of their glaring absurdities, no lack of warm admirers.
Miss Seward, in her <cite>Life of Dr. Darwin</cite>, published in 1804, sets no limits to her
admiration:—“We are presented,” she says, “with an highly imaginative and
splendidly descriptive poem, whose successive pictures alternately possess the
sublimity of Michael Angelo, the correctness and elegance of Raphael, with the
glow of Titian; whose landscapes have, at times, the strength of Salvator, and
at others the softness of Claude; whose numbers are of stately grace, and artful
harmony; while its allusions to ancient and modern history and fable, and its
interspersion of recent and extraordinary anecdotes, render it extremely entertaining.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Each part is enriched by a number of philosophical notes.
They state a great variety of theories and experiments in Botany, Chemistry,
Electricity, Mechanics, and in the various species of Air, salubrious, noxious,
and deadly,” &amp;c.]</p>

    <div>THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>[<span class='sc'>Thomas Muir</span>, the younger, of Hunter’s Hill, a promising young advocate
of the Scottish Bar, and of nigh respectability, was tried at Edinburgh, 30th
and 31st of August, 1793, before Lord Justice Clerk (Braxfield), Lords Henderland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Swinton, Dunsinnan, and Abercromby, for Sedition. The weightiest
charge against him was that of “<em>lending</em>” a copy of Paine’s <cite>Rights of Man</cite> to a
person who begged a reading of that popular book. He was found guilty, and
sentenced to fourteen years’ transportation. On the 17th of the ensuing
month, the Rev. <span class='sc'>Thos. Fyshe Palmer</span>, a Unitarian Minister of Dundee, and an
ex-fellow of Queen’s College, Cambridge, was tried at Perth for publishing a
seditious Address, and sentenced to seven years’ transportation. On their
arrival at Woolwich, in a revenue cutter, they were put on board separate
hulks, and assisted at the common labour on the banks of the river. <span class='sc'>Muir</span>,
soon after his arrival in New South Wales, effected his escape, in an American
vessel, to South America, whence he proceeded to Spain. During this voyage,
in an action with a British frigate, he received a wound in the head, from
which he recovered; but on his arrival at his destination, he was imprisoned
by the Spanish authorities, until, on the application of M. de Talleyrand in the
name of the then government of France, he obtained his release. He then
went to France, and died at Bourdeaux [or Chantilly] in 1799; aged 33.
<span class='sc'>Palmer</span> served out his seven years, but died on the homeward voyage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Other Trials soon followed. At the close of December, 1793, <span class='sc'>Mr. Skirving</span>,
<span class='sc'>Mr. Gerrald</span>, and <span class='sc'>Mr. Margarot</span> were tried at Edinburgh on similar charges
of seditious practices, and were all sentenced to fourteen years’ transportation.
The former two died soon after reaching New South Wales. <span class='sc'>Maurice Margarot</span>,
who appears to have conducted himself throughout with the most
abandoned and shameless profligacy, was the only one of these convicts—his
fourteen years over—who ever set foot again in Britain.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gerrald</span> was a man of very superior ability, and a favourite pupil of Dr.
Parr’s, as is mentioned by De Quincey in his famous essay on that noted Whig
pedagogue.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the Scottish “political martyrs” Lord Cockburn, in his posthumous
<cite>Examination of the Trials for Sedition in Scotland</cite>, published in 1888, which deals
with the twenty-five trials of the above-named five and of thirty-two others, between
1793 and 1849, passes his deliberate verdict, that, with the exception of
Muir, not one of them was guiltless. But, like ordinary criminals, they were
entitled to a fair and impartial trial; and their trials were, one and all, iniquitous.
Of the six judges who presided in the first fourteen (1793–94), five were
dull, timid nonentities; the sixth, Lord Justice Clerk Braxfield, was, says
Lord Cockburn, “a profound practical lawyer, and a powerful man; coarse
and illiterate&nbsp;... utterly devoid of judicial decorum, and though pure in the
administration of civil justice, when he was exposed to no temptation, with no
other conception of principle in any political case except that the upholding of
his party was a duty attaching to his position. Over the five weak men who sat
beside him, this coarse and dexterous ruffian predominated as he chose.” But
Jedburgh—no, nor the Bloody Assize itself—could scarcely match one scene in
Gerrald’s trial:—“‘After all,’ he was urging in his defence, ‘the most useful
discoveries in philosophy, the most important changes in the moral history of
man, have been innovations. The Revolution was an innovation, Christianity
itself was an innovation.’ Instantly upon this, the following interruption took
place:—Lord Braxfield: ‘You would have been stopped long before this, if
you had not been a stranger. All that you have been saying is sedition. And
now, my Lords, he is attacking Christianity.’ Lord Henderland: ‘I allow him
all the benefit of his defence. But&nbsp;... I cannot sit here as a judge without
saying that it is a most indecent defence....’ The juries were packed as
never, surely, before, or afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With such judges, such juries, and, at least, in two cases, false witnesses, it
might seem easy to anticipate the result; but the result transcends anticipation.
In almost every case a light sentence would have amply met the requirements
of justice; but the judges all shared Lord Swinton’s opinion that “it is impossible
to punish Sedition adequately, now that torture has been abolished”. So
they strove to supply the deficiency by Transportation, a punishment unwarranted
by precedent.</p>

<p class='c009'>With respect to Margarot’s trial at Edinburgh, the following is a vivid
memory of Lord Cockburn’s boyhood:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Margarot</span> came from the Black Bull [in Leith Street] to be tried, attended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>by a procession of the populace and his Convention friends, with banners and
what was called a tree of liberty. This tree was in the shape of the letter M,
about twenty feet high and ten wide. The honour of bearing it up by carrying
the two upright poles was assigned to two eminent Conventionalists, and the
little culprit walked beneath the circular placard in the centre, which proclaimed
liberty and equality, &amp;c. I was looking out of a window in the old Post-Office,
which was then the northmost house on the west side of the North Bridge.
I think I see the scene yet. The whole North Bridge, from the Tron Church to
the Register Office, was quite empty at first; not a single creature venturing on
that bit of sand, over which the waves were so soon to break from both ends.
The Post-Office and the adjoining houses had been secretly filled with constables,
and sailors from a frigate in the roads (I think <em>The Hind</em>, Capt. Cochrane), all
armed with sticks and batons. No soldier appeared, it being determined that
this civic insurrection should be put down by the civil force, unaided, at least,
by scarlet. As soon as the tree, which led the van, emerged from Leith Street,
and appeared at the north end of the bridge, Provost Elder and the Magistrates
issued from some place they had retired to (I believe the Tron Church), and appeared,
all robed, at the south end. The day was good. There was still not
one person—I doubt if there was even a dog—on any part of the space, being the
whole length of the bridge, between the two parties. But the rear of
each was crammed with people, who filled up every inch as those in front
moved on. The Magistrates were in a line across the street, with the Provost
in the centre, the city officers behind this line, and probably a hundred loyal
gentlemen in the rear of the officers. The two parties advanced steadily
towards each other, and in perfect silence, till they met just about the Post-Office.
The Provost stepped forward about a pace, so that he almost touched
the front line of the rebels, when, advancing his cane, he commanded them to
retire. This order probably would not have been obeyed; but, at any rate, it
could not have been obeyed speedily, from the crowd behind. However, all
this was immaterial; for, without waiting one instant to see whether they
meant to retire or not, the houses vomited forth their bludgeoned contents, and
in almost two minutes the tree was demolished and thrown over the bridge, the
street covered with the knocked down, the accused dragged to the bar, and the
insurrection was over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On February 20th, 1837, a meeting took place at the Crown and Anchor
Tavern, Strand, for commencing a subscription to erect monuments in London
and Edinburgh to the memory of the above five Reformers. Joseph Hume,
M.P. was in the chair; Colonel Perronet Thompson, Mr. Dan. Whittle Harvey,
and fifteen other members of Parliament were present. A lofty obelisk was
erected on the Calton Hill to the memory of the “Scottish Martyrs,” but
London did not sympathize with the movement.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c009'>[<span class='sc'>Joel Barlow</span>, born in 1756 in Connecticut, was educated as a Presbyterian
minister, but afterwards turned Deist. Before this change he translated the
Psalms into metre, and his version is still used in the churches of New England.
He now adopted the Law, and engaged in periodicals—one, <cite>The Anarchist</cite>,
which was political in its character, and exercised great influence. In 1788,
after visiting England, he went to Paris, where he joined the Girondists. In
1791, he returned to England, where he published the first part of his <cite>Advice to
the Privileged Orders</cite>, in which he assails the whole system of Government
pursued in monarchical Europe, the Church establishments, the standing
armies, the judicial organisations, and the financial systems which belong to
the old governments. In February, 1792, he published a political poem, which
he entitled <cite>The Conspiracy of Kings</cite>; also a Letter to the <em>Convention</em> advising
the separation of Church and State. So great did his reputation become that
he was fixed on by the London Constitutional Society to present their Address
to the <em>Convention</em>. After various political transactions in the interest of France,
and also in commercial speculations which made him a rich man, he left Paris
in 1805, living on his estate in America till 1811, when he was sent as Minister
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Plenipotentiary to Paris. But Napoleon being on his Russian Expedition, he
followed him to Wilna; but the fatiguing journey proved fatal: he died 26th
December, 1812. He wrote at an early age a poem, <cite>The Vision of Columbus</cite>, which
acquired great popularity, and which he afterwards enlarged as <cite>The Columbiad</cite>.
Among other works he published (in 1796) a mock-heroic poem, <cite>Hasty Pudding</cite>,
which is generally considered his best work.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>[<span class='sc'>Theobald Wolfe Tone</span>, the founder of the <span class='sc'>Association of United Irishmen</span>,
was born in Dublin in 1764, and, after passing through Trinity College,
came to London to prosecute his legal studies, which he soon forsook for
politics, being induced thereto by the indignation excited in his breast by the
persecution of the Irish Catholics, whose cause, although himself a Protestant,
he warmly advocated. With the view of getting their grievances redressed, he
founded the society of <span class='sc'>United Irishmen</span>, which gave great alarm to the English
Government. His liberty being menaced, he went to America, and thence to
France, where he arranged with Gen. Hoche the expeditions to Bantry Bay and
the Texel. Being appointed Adjutant-General, he served in several of the
French armies, and lastly in Gen. Hardi’s expedition to Ireland in October,
1798. The vessel he was aboard of was captured by the English, and he was
conveyed to Dublin, tried by a Court-Martial, and sentenced to be hanged.
He anticipated his execution, however, by committing suicide in prison, 19th
November, 1798.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

    <div>ARTHUR O’CONNOR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>[On the 21st and 22nd May, 1798, <span class='sc'>Arthur O’Connor</span> (proprietor of a Dublin
newspaper, <cite>The Press</cite>), <span class='sc'>John Binns</span> (an active member of the <em>London Corresponding
Society</em>), <span class='sc'>John Allen</span>, <span class='sc'>Jeremiah Leary</span>, and <span class='sc'>Jas. O’Coigly</span>, <em>alias</em> Jas.
Quigley, <em>alias</em> Jas. John Fivey (a Priest), were tried at Maidstone for High
Treason. <span class='sc'>Robert Fergusson</span> was counsel for Allen. <span class='sc'>O’Coigly</span> only was found
Guilty, and was executed 7th June, on Pennenden Heath. After being suspended
for ten minutes, he was cut down and his head severed from his body:
the disgusting remainder of his sentence was remitted. He met his death with
great fortitude, and denying to the last the charge of treasonable correspondence
abroad. In the <em>State Trials</em>, vols. 26 and 27, are included the Life of the
prisoner; Observations on his Trial; Address to the People of Ireland; and
Letters, all written by himself during his confinement in Maidstone Gaol. His
real name, he says, was the Rev. Jas. Coigly, and his age 36. “Can you
imagine a man more treacherous and profligate than <span class='sc'>O’Coigly</span>?” said Sir James
Mackintosh to <span class='sc'>Dr. Parr</span>. “Yes, Sir, he might have been worse: he was a
parson—he might have been a lawyer; he was a traitor—he might have been
an apostate; he was an Irishman—he might have been a Scotchman.” When
it is recollected that Mackintosh was a Scotchman and a lawyer, and that he
had written in defence of the French Revolution against Burke, these observations
of Dr. Parr were both insolent and uncalled for.</p>

<p class='c009'>A Portrait of “Arthur O’Connor, late Member in the Irish Parliament for
Borough of Philipstown, painted by J. Dowling, engraved by W. Ward,” was
published in London, 18th April, 1798. Another Portrait in military uniform is
to be found in Barrington’s <cite>Memoirs of the Union</cite>. He figures also in several
of <span class='sc'>Gillray’s</span> <cite>Caricatures</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the <cite>Birmingham Daily Post</cite> of April 2, 1888, it is stated that <span class='sc'>The Hon. R.
E. O’Connor</span>, M.A., barrister-at-law, the latest addition to the Legislative
Council of New South Wales, is a grandson of <span class='sc'>Arthur O’Connor</span>, one of the
leaders of the United Irishmen, who died a General in the service of France.</p>

<p class='c009'>When <span class='sc'>O’Connor</span> was acquitted by the Jury, on the above-named occasion,
but before the Judge had given orders for his release, a strange scene occurred
in court, an attempt being made, as it was alleged, by <span class='sc'>Sackville, Earl of
Thanet</span>, <span class='sc'>Robert Fergusson</span> (in after years known as <span class='sc'>Cutlar Fergusson</span>,
Judge-Advocate-General), and others to facilitate his escape in order to avoid
further charges about to be preferred against him, Binns also being implicated
for this exploit, which was unsuccessful, but attended with violence. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>confederates were tried at the Bar of the Court of King’s Bench, 25th
April, 1799. The Counsel for the Crown were Sir John Scott [Lord Eldon],
Law [Lord Ellenborough], Sir W. Garrow, Sir C. Abbot, &amp;c., while the
defendants had the powerful advocacy of Erskine and others. His
Lordship and Mr. Fergusson were found guilty after a long and ingenious
defence by the latter, which presaged his future eminence as a Counsel. <span class='sc'>Lord
Thanet</span> was ordered to pay a fine of £1000; to be imprisoned in the Tower for a
year; and to give security for good behaviour for seven years on the expiration
of the sentence; himself in £10,000, and two sureties in £5000 each. <span class='sc'>Fergusson</span>
was ordered to pay a fine of £100; to be imprisoned in the King’s Bench
prison for one year; to give security for good behaviour for seven years from

    <div>JAMES NAPPER TANDY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>[“A person who afterwards made a considerable figure in the local affairs
of Ireland raised himself about this time into considerable notoriety by his
patriotic exertions. This was Mr. <span class='sc'>James Napper Tandy</span>, a gentleman in
the middle station of life, without talent or natural influence, had become a
warm advocate in the corporation of Dublin; he debated zealously in public,
he argued strenuously in private, and persevered in both with indefatigable
ardour. His person was ungracious—his language neither eloquent nor
argumentative—his address neither graceful nor impressive—but he was
sincere and persevering—and though in many instances erroneous and violent,
he was considered to be honest. His private character furnished no ground to
doubt the integrity of his public one—and, like many of those persons who
occasionally spring up in revolutionary periods, he acquired celebrity without
being able to account for it, and possessed influence without rank or capacity.
In 1796, Mr. Tandy lost all his popularity, and nearly his life, by his apparent
want of courage in an affair between him and Mr. Toler, then Solicitor-General,
afterwards Lord Norbury, and Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. Mr. Tandy
having signified to Mr. Toler his desire to fight him, the Chief Justice readily
accepted the offer. Both parties manœuvred very skilfully; but Mr. Tandy
delaying his ultimatum too long for the impatience of the Solicitor-General, he
brought him before the House of Commons for a breach of privilege, and prosecuted
him for sedition. Mr. Tandy escaped to the Continent, entered the
French Service, invaded Ireland, was, with his confederates, arrested by the
British Envoy at Hamburg, 24 Nov., 1798, contrary to the law of nations: the
Minister of France claimed them as French citizens, and the Senate, unwilling
to offend either power, came to no decision on the subject. Tandy was
thereupon taken to Ireland and condemned to be hanged—was pardoned by
Lord Cornwallis, and sent back to France, where he died a French General.”—Barrington’s

<p class='c009'>[<span class='sc'>Muskein</span> was an inhabitant of Antwerp, whom the Directory not only
appointed to superintend the construction of the flat-bottomed boats for the
invasion of Great Britain (usually called by the French sailors “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bateaux à la
Muskein</span></i>”), but made a “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">capitaine de vaisseau</span></i>”. An attack was ordered to be
made upon the two small islands of <span class='sc'>Saint Marcouf</span> (each not more than 200
yards in length), of which, in July, 1795, <span class='sc'>Sir Sidney Smith</span>, with the Diamond
frigate, had taken unobstructed possession, and which were considered to give
to the English great facility in intercepting between the ports of Havre and
Cherbourg. The islands are situated off the river Isigny, on the coast of Normandy,
and about four miles distant from the French shore. After being
garrisoned with about 500 seamen and marines, including a great proportion of
invalids, these small islands were placed under the command of <span class='sc'>Lieut.
Charles Papps Price</span>, of <em>The Badger</em>, a cruiser-converted Dutch hoy, mounting
four, or at most six, guns.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 8th April, 1798, <span class='sc'>Muskein</span>, with 33 flat-bottomed boats, with a body
of troops on board, and a few gun-brigs, was about to make a combined attack
on the two islands, but was driven off by two British frigates, <span class='sc'>The Diamond</span>,
<em>Capt. Sir R. J. Strachan</em>, and <span class='sc'>The Hydra</span>, <em>Capt. Sir Francis Laforey</em>, and stood
into Caen river. While there for three weeks, repairing damages, he was joined
by seven heavy gun-brigs, and about 40 flat-boats and armed fishing vessels,
bringing with them additional troops.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 6th May, <span class='sc'>Lieut. Price</span> received information that an attack was
meditated during the night. By 10 p.m., owing to the prevailing calm, the
small naval force on the station, consisting of the 50–gun ship, <span class='sc'>Adamant</span>, <em>Capt.
Wm. Hotham</em>, 24–gun ship, <span class='sc'>Eurydice</span>, <em>Capt. John Talbot</em>, and 18–gun brig-sloop,
<span class='sc'>Orestes</span>, <em>Capt. W. Haggitt</em>, had not been able to approach nearer to the islands
than six miles—precisely what the assailants wanted. The attacking force
consisted of 52–gun brigs and flat-bottomed boats, having on board, as was reported,
about 6000 men. At day-break, on the 7th, the flotilla was seen drawn
up in a line opposite to the south-west front of the western redoubt; and
instantly was opened, upon the brigs and flats composing it, a fire from 17
pieces of cannon, consisting of four 4, two 6, and six 24 pounder long guns, and
three 24 and two 32–pounder carronades, being all the guns that would bear.
The brigs remained at a distance of from 300 to 400 yards, in order to batter the
redoubt with their heavy long guns, while the boats, with great resolution,
rowed up until within musket-shot of the battery. But the guns of the latter,
loaded with round, grape, and canister, soon poured destruction amongst these,
cutting several of the boats “into chips,” and compelling all that could keep
afloat to seek their safety in flight. Six or seven boats were seen to go down,
and one small flat, No. 13, was afterwards towed in, bottom upwards. She
appeared, by some pieces of paper found in her, to have had 144 persons on
board, including 129 of the second company of the Boulogne battalion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The loss sustained by the British garrison amounted to one private-marine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>killed, and two private-marines and two seamen wounded. According to one
French account, the invaders lost about 900 in killed or drowned, and between
300 and 400 wounded. As a reward for their conduct on this occasion, Lieutenants
<span class='sc'>Price</span> and <span class='sc'>Bourne</span> were each promoted to the rank of Commander. The
former died a Post Captain, at Hereford, in 1813, aged 62.—<cite>James’s Naval History</cite>,
vol. ii., pp. 128–131: ed. 1886.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c009'>[M. <span class='sc'>Pléville</span> was Minister of Marine, and, shortly after this unsuccessful
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</span></i> of the famous flotilla, was succeeded by Rear-Adm. Bruix, who directed
Rear-Adm. La Crosse to take the command, and to make a second attack upon
the islands. This, however, the French Government declined to make.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

    <div>HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Helen Maria Williams.</span>—[“Among the literary celebrities of the French
Revolution was Helen Maria Williams, at whose house were wont to assemble
the most distinguished of the liberal writers of France, her own reputation
giving considerable <em>éclat</em> to these meetings. She wrote some of the most
beautiful hymns in our language, was a prisoner under the <em>reign of terror</em>, and
published a work on the French Revolution which is full of the most touching
incidents, and adorned with specimens of the ardent and pathetic poetry, the
product of French genius under the excitement of those most mysterious days.
A. Humboldt was much attached to her, and committed to her care the translation
and publication of some of his most elaborate works.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She had two nephews, <span class='sc'>Athanas</span> and <span class='sc'>Charles Coquerel</span>, whom she
educated, and who both attained considerable fame, one in the theological and
the other in the political field. Athanas was for some time the preacher in the
Protestant Church at Amsterdam, and married the daughter of a Swiss gentleman,
the only person I have ever known on the Continent to adopt the dress and
profess the opinions of an English Quaker. Miss Williams maintained intimate
relations with her English friends, was familiar with the great lights of the
Revolution, and her conversation was most instructive, entertaining, and
varied. All her sympathies were on the side of freedom, and though she was
not so prominent as to be persecuted by the Emperor, like Madame de Staël,
she was the object of a good deal of suspicion and narrowly watched by the
police.”—<cite>Autobr. Recollections by Sir John Bowring</cite>, pp. 353–4.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c009'>[<span class='sc'>Miss Williams</span>, for some years, wrote that portion of the <cite>New Annual Register</cite>
which relates to France. Among many other productions she was the author
of the song <cite>Evan Banks</cite> (to the tune of <cite>Savourna Delish</cite>), which has often been
attributed to Burns; a novel called <cite>Julia</cite>, and a <cite>Tour in Switzerland</cite>. Horace
Walpole called her in his <span class='sc'>Correspondence</span> a “scribbling trollop”.</p>

<p class='c009'>She lived for many years, and until the death of that gentleman—in Paris,
1818—under the <em>protection</em> of <span class='sc'>John Hurford Stone</span>, a man of letters, who in
the early part of the French Revolution had removed with his wife to Paris,
where he formed an intimacy with Miss Williams. She was born about 1762,
and died in Paris in 1827 as a friend to the Bourbons, and the enemy of the
Revolution!</p>

<p class='c009'>This <span class='sc'>Mr. Stone</span> was born at Tiverton in 1763. While in Paris he was in the
confidence of the Directory, and became one of the chief printers there. In
1805, he brought out an edition of the <cite>Geneva Bible</cite>, and published several
English reprints; also Miss Williams’s translation of <span class='sc'>Humboldt’s</span> <cite>Travels</cite>. His
brother, <span class='sc'>Wm. Stone</span>, was tried in 1796 for High Treason, for holding treasonable
correspondence with him.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<h3 class='c031'>ELEGY<br /> <span class='small'>ON THE DEATH OF JEAN BON ST. ANDRÉ.</span></h3>

<p class='c043'>The following exquisite tribute to the memory of an
unfortunate republican is written with such a touching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>sensibility, that those who can command salt tears must
prepare to shed them. The narrative is simple and unaffected;
the event in itself interesting; the moral
obvious and awful.—We have only to observe, that as
this account of the transaction is taken from the French
papers, it may possibly be somewhat partial.—The
<span class='sc'>Dey’s</span> own statement of the affair has not yet been
received. Every friend of humanity will join with us in
expressing a candid and benevolent hope, that this business
may not tend to kindle the flames of war between
these two unchristian powers; but that, by mutual concession
and accommodation, they may come to some
point (short of the restoration of <span class='sc'>Jean Bon’s</span> head on his
shoulders, which in this stage of the discussion is hardly
practicable) by which the peace of the Pagan world may
be preserved. For our part, we pretend not to decide
from which quarter the concessions ought principally to
be made. It is but candid to allow that there are probably
faults on <em>both sides</em>, in this, as in most other cases.
For the character of the <span class='sc'>Dey</span> we profess a sincere respect
on the one hand; and on the other, we naturally
wish that the head of <span class='sc'>Jean Bon St. André</span> should be
reserved for his own guillotine.</p>

<p class='c007'>On recurring to the French papers to verify our Correspondent’s
statement of this singular adventure of
<span class='sc'>Jean Bon St. André</span>, we discovered, to our great mortification,
that it happened at <span class='sc'>Algiers</span>, and not at <span class='sc'>Tunis</span>.
We should have corrected this mistake, but for two
reasons—first, that <span class='sc'>Algiers</span> would not stand in the
verse; and, secondly, that we are informed by the young
man who conducts the Geographical Department of the
<cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, that both the towns are in Africa, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Asia (he is not quite certain which), and, what is more
to the purpose, that both are peopled by Moors. <span class='sc'>Tunis</span>,
therefore, may stand.</p>

<p class='c007'>[<span class='sc'>Marshal Bernadotté</span>, the French <em>Prince of Monté Corvo</em>, died as <span class='sc'>Charles
John XIV.</span>, <em>King of Sweden</em>, 8th March, 1844, in his eighty-first year. He
married, in 1798, <span class='sc'>Eugenia-Bernardina-Désirée de Clary</span>, daughter of a
Marseilles merchant, and sister of <span class='sc'>Madame Joseph Buonaparte</span> (Queen of
Spain). “She, who was not a common-place person,” says <span class='sc'>Madame de
Rémusat</span>, in her valuable <cite>Memoirs</cite>, “had before her marriage been very much
in love with Napoleon, and appears to have always preserved the memory of
that feeling! It has been supposed that her hardly extinguished passion
caused her obstinate refusal to leave France.” She survived her husband
many years, and died in Paris, in the Rue d’Anjou Saint Honoré. Her husband
was succeeded on the throne of Sweden by their son, <span class='sc'>Oscar I.</span>, who married
<span class='sc'>Joséphine</span>, <em>daughter of</em> <span class='sc'>Eugène Beauharnais</span>, Duc de Leuchtenberg, and
<em>granddaughter of the</em> <span class='sc'>Empress Josephine</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bernadotté</span> owed his elevation to the throne to the misgovernment of
Gustavus IV., who had brought the nation to the verge of ruin, and who was deposed
in 1809, when his uncle, the Duke of Sudermania, became king as Charles
XIII.; and the next year, <span class='sc'>Bernadotté</span> was elected <em>Crown Prince</em>, and successor
to the throne.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1813, he rendered great assistance to the Allies, for, as Crown Prince, he
joined the confederacy against France with 30,000 men; and, after defeating
Marshal Ney, with great loss, on the 6th September, he, on the 18th October,
with the co-operation of Blücher, again defeated him at the decisive Battle of
Leipsic; and, on the 19th, the Emperor Alexander, the King of Prussia, and
the Crown Prince, entered the great square of Leipsic, amidst the acclamations
of the inhabitants. He was a decided democrat, and hated by Napoleon, but
was the only sovereign of the revolutionary branch who was permitted to retain
his dominions after the great reaction in 1814. The choice made of this
great soldier of fortune excited the surprise of all Europe at the time, but the
wisdom of it was soon demonstrated by his prudent conduct. He had
distinguished himself from all Napoleon’s other marshals by his clemency
in victory. For half a century before his accession, Sweden had not known the
peace and prosperity in which he left the country on his death.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <span class='sc'>T. Raikes’s</span> <cite>Diary</cite> will be found some interesting anecdotes of <span class='sc'>Bernadotté’s</span>
gratitude for services rendered him while a young subaltern. But one
is of a more startling nature, as it records his narrow escape from the death
intended for him by the widow of the late king, who had purposely prepared a
poisoned cup of coffee for him, which she herself presented to him at her own
table. Having been suddenly warned, he succeeded in forcing it upon her.
She resolutely accepted her fate, and died during the night.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c007'>We have received the following letter, with the poem
that accompanies it, from a gentleman whose political
opinions have hitherto differed from our own; but who
appears to feel, as every man who loves his country
must, that there can be but one sentiment entertained
by Englishmen at the present moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Were we at liberty, we should be happy to do justice
to the author, and credit to ourselves, by mentioning his
name.</p>

<h3 class='c031'>TO THE EDITOR OF THE “ANTI-JACOBIN”.</h3>

<p class='c043'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—However men may have differed on the political
or constitutional questions which have of late been
brought into discussion—whatever opinions they may
have held on the system or conduct of administration—there
can surely be now but one sentiment as to the
instant necessity of firm and strenuous union for the
preservation of our very existence as a people; and if
degrees of obligation could be admitted, where the
utmost is required from all, it should seem that in this
cause the opposers of administration stand doubly
pledged; for with what face of consistency can men pretend
to stickle for points of constitutional liberty at
home, who will not be found amongst the foremost at
their posts to defend their country from the yoke of
foreign slavery?</p>

<p class='c007'>That there should be any set of men so infatuated as
not to be convinced that the object of the enemy must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>be the utter destruction of these countries, after making
the largest allowance for the effects of prejudice and
passion, it is not easy to conceive. Such, however, we
are told, there are. They believe, then, that after a long
series of outrage, insult, and injury, in the height of
their animosity and presumption, these moderate, mild,
disinterested conquerors will invade us in arms, out of
pure love and kindness, merely for our good, only to
make us wiser, and better, and happier, and more prosperous
than before!</p>

<p class='c007'>Future events lie hid in the volume of Fate, but the
intentions of men may be known by almost infallible
indications. Passion and interest, the two mighty
motives of human action, determine the Government of
France to attempt the abolition of the British Empire!
and if, abandoned by God and our right arm, we should
flinch in the conflict, that destruction will be operative
to the full of their gigantic and monstrous imaginations!—Harbours
filled up with the ruins of their towns and
arsenals, the Thames rendered a vast morass, by burying
the Imperial City in her bosom—but I will not proceed
in the horrible picture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are we then, it may be asked, to wage eternal war?—No;
a glorious resistance leads to an honourable peace.
The French people have been long weary of the war;
their spirit has been forced by a system which must end
in the failure of the engagement to give them the plunder
of this country. They will awake from their dream, and
raise a cry for peace, which their government will not
dare to resist. The monarchs of Europe must now begin
clearly to perceive that their fate hangs on the destiny
of England; they will unite to compel a satisfactory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>peace on a broad foundation; and peace, when war has
been tried to the utmost, will probably be permanent.
A few years of wise economy and redoubled industry
will place us again on the rising scale; and if the pressure
of the times may have rendered it necessary sometimes
to have cast a temporary veil over the statue of
Liberty, she may again safely be shown in an unimpaired
lustre.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the following verses I have nothing to say: if it
should be decided that the greatness of the object cannot
bear out the mediocrity of the execution, I will not appeal
from the decision.</p>

<div class='c033'>June 4, 1798.</div>

<p class='c007'>Our ingenious correspondent, <span class='sc'>Mr. Higgins</span>, has not
been idle. The deserved popularity of the extracts which
we have been enabled to give from his two didactic
poems, the <cite>Progress of Man</cite>, and the <cite>Loves of the Triangles</cite>,
has obtained for us the communications of several other
works which he has in hand, all framed upon the same
principle, and directed to the same end. The propagation
of the New System of Philosophy forms, as he has
himself candidly avowed to us, the main object of all his
writings. A system, comprehending not politics only
and religion, but morals and manners, and generally
whatever goes to the composition or holding together of
human society; in all of which a total change and revolution
is absolutely necessary (as he contends) for the
advancement of our common nature to its true dignity,
and to the summit of that perfection which the combination
of matter, called <span class='sc'>Man</span>, is by its innate energies
capable of attaining.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of this system, while the sublimer and more scientific
branches are to be taught by the splendid and striking
medium of didactic poetry, or <em>ratiocination in rhyme</em>,
illustrated with such paintings and portraitures of
essences and their attributes as may lay hold of the
imagination while they perplex the judgment;—the
more ordinary parts, such as relate to the conduct of
common life and the regulation of social feelings, are
naturally the subject of a less elevated style of writing;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>of a style which speaks to the eye as well as to the ear,—in
short, of dramatic poetry and scenic representation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With this view,” says <span class='sc'>Mr. Higgins</span> (for we love to
quote the very words of this extraordinary and indefatigable
writer),—“with this view,” says he, in a letter
dated from his study in St. Mary Axe, the window of
which looks upon the parish pump,—“with this view I
have turned my thoughts more particularly to the
German stage, and have composed—in imitation of the
most popular pieces of that country, which have already
met with so general reception and admiration in this—a
Play; which, if it has a proper run, will, I think, do
much to unhinge the present notions of men with regard
to the obligations of civil society, and to substitute, in
lieu of a sober contentment, and regular discharge of the
duties incident to each man’s particular situation, a wild
desire of undefinable latitude and extravagance,—an
aspiration after shapeless somethings that can neither be
described nor understood,—a contemptuous disgust at
all that <em>is</em>, and a persuasion that nothing is as it ought
to be;—to operate, in short, a general discharge of every
man (in his own estimation) from every tie which laws,
divine or human, which local customs, immemorial
habits, and multiplied examples, impose upon him; and
to set them about doing what they like, where they like,
when they like, and how they like,—without reference to
any law but their own will, or to any consideration of
how others may be affected by their conduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When this is done, my dear sir,” continues Mr. H.
(for he writes very confidentially)—“you see that a great
step is gained towards the dissolution of the frame of
every existing community. I say nothing of <em>Governments</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>as <em>their</em> fall is of course implicated in that of the social
system;—and you have long known that I hold every
Government (that acts by coercion and restriction—by
laws made by the few to bind the many) as a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">malum in
se</span></i>,—an evil to be eradicated,—a nuisance to be abated,—by
force, if force be practicable; if not, by the artillery
of reason, by pamphlets, speeches, toasts at club-dinners,
and though last, not least, by didactic poems.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But where would be the advantage of the destruction
of this or that Government, if the form of Society itself
were to be suffered to continue such as that another
must necessarily arise out of it and over it?—Society,
my dear sir, in its present state, is a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">hydra</span></i>. Cut off one
head,—another presently sprouts out, and your labour
is to begin again. At best you can only hope to find it a
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">polypus</span></i>;—where, by cutting off the <em>head</em>, you are sometimes
fortunate enough to find a <em>tail</em> (which answers all
the same purposes) spring up in its place. This, we
know, has been the case in France; the only country in
which the great experiment of regeneration has been
tried with anything like a fair chance of success.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Destroy the frame of society,—decompose its parts,—and
see the elements fighting one against another,—insulated
and individual,—every man for himself (stripped
of prejudice, of bigotry, and of feeling for others) against
the remainder of his species;—and there is then some
hope of a totally new <em>order of things</em>,—of a <em>Radical Reform</em>
in the present corrupt system of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The German Theatre appears to proceed on this
judicious plan. And I have endeavoured to contribute
my mite towards extending its effect and its popularity.
There is one obvious advantage attending this mode of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>teaching;—that it can proportion the infractions of law,
religion, or morality, which it recommends, to the
capacity of a reader or spectator. If you tell a student,
or an apprentice, or a merchant’s clerk, of the virtue of a
Brutus, or of the splendour of a La Fayette, you may
excite his <em>desire</em> to be equally conspicuous; but how is
he to set about it? Where is he to find the tyrant to
murder? How is he to provide the monarch to be imprisoned,
and the national guards to be reviewed on a
white horse?—But paint the beauties of <em>forgery</em> to him
in glowing colours;—show him that the presumption of
virtue is in favour of rapine and occasional murder on
the highway—and he presently understands you. The
highway is at hand—the till or the counter is within
reach. These <em>haberdashers’ heroics</em> come home to the
business and the bosoms of men.—And you may readily
make ten <em>footpads</em>, where you would not have materials
nor opportunity for a single <em>tyrannicide</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The subject of the piece which I herewith transmit
to you is taken from common or middling life; and its
merit is that of teaching the most lofty truths in the
most humble style, and deducing them from the most
ordinary occurrences. Its moral is obvious and easy;
and is one frequently inculcated by the German dramas
which I have had the good fortune to see; being no other
than ‘<em>the reciprocal duties of one or more husbands to one or
more wives, and to the children who may happen to arise out
of this complicated and endearing connection</em>’. The plot,
indeed, is formed by the combination of the plots of <em>two</em>
of the most popular of these plays (in the same way as
Terence was wont to combine two stories of Menander’s).
The characters are such as the admirers of these plays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>will recognise for their familiar acquaintances. There
are the usual ingredients of imprisonments, post-houses
and horns, and appeals to angels and devils. I have
omitted only the <em>swearing</em>, to which English ears are not
yet sufficiently accustomed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I transmit at the same time a <em>Prologue</em>, which in
some degree breaks the matter to the audience. About
the song of Rogero, at the end of the first Act, I am less
anxious than about any other part of the performance,
as it is, in fact, literally translated from the composition
of a young German friend of mine, an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Illuminé</span></i>, of whom
I bought the original for three-and-sixpence. It will be
a satisfaction to those of your readers who may not at
first sight hit upon the tune, to learn that it is setting by
a hand of the first eminence.—I send also a rough sketch
of the plot, and a few occasional notes.—The <em>geography</em>
is by the young gentleman of the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mat.</span> Is it impossible for me to have dinner sooner?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Land.</span> Madam, the Brunswick post-waggon is not yet

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mat.</span> [<em>With a look expressive of disappointment, but immediately
recomposing herself.</em>] Well, then, I must have
patience. [<em>Exit Landlady.</em>] Oh Casimere!—How often
have the thoughts of thee served to amuse these moments
of expectation!—What a difference, alas!—Dinner—it is
taken away as soon as over, and we regret it not!—It
returns again with the return of appetite.—The beef of
to-morrow will succeed to the mutton of to-day, as the
mutton of to-day succeeded to the veal of yesterday.
But when once the heart has been occupied by a beloved
object, in vain would we attempt to supply the chasm by
another. How easily are our desires transferred from
dish to dish!—Love only, dear, delusive, delightful love,
restrains our wandering appetites, and confines them to
a particular gratification!...</p>

<p class='c041'><em>Scene changes to a subterranean vault in the Abbey of Quedlinburgh,
with coffins, ’scutcheons, death’s heads and crossbones—toads and
other loathsome reptiles are seen traversing the obscurer parts of the
stage.</em>—<span class='sc'>Rogero</span> <em>appears, in chains, in a suit of rusty armour, with
his beard grown, and a cap of a grotesque form upon his head—beside
him a crock, or pitcher, supposed to contain his daily allowance
of sustenance.—A long silence, during which the wind is
heard to whistle through the caverns.</em>—<span class='sc'>Rogero</span> <em>rises, and comes
slowly forward, with his arms folded.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Rog.</span> Eleven years! it is now eleven years since I was
first immured in this living sepulchre—the cruelty of a
Minister—the perfidy of a Monk—yes, Matilda! for thy
sake—alive amidst the dead—chained—coffined—confined—cut
off from the converse of my fellow-men. Soft!—what
have we here! [<em>stumbles over a bundle of sticks.</em>]
This cavern is so dark that I can scarcely distinguish the
objects under my feet. Oh—the register of my captivity.
Let me see; how stands the account? [<em>Takes up the sticks,
and turns them over with a melancholy air; then stands silent
for a few minutes, as if absorbed in calculation.</em>]—Eleven
years and fifteen days!—Hah! the twenty-eighth of
August! How does the recollection of it vibrate on my
heart! It was on this day that I took my last leave of
my Matilda. It was a summer evening; her melting
hand seemed to dissolve in mine, as I prest it to my
bosom. Some demon whispered me that I should never
see her more. I stood gazing on the hated vehicle which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>was conveying her away for ever. The tears were petrified
under my eyelids. My heart was crystallized with
agony. Anon—I looked along the road. The diligence
seemed to diminish every instant; I felt my heart beat
against its prison, as if anxious to leap out and overtake
it. My soul whirled round as I watched the rotation of
the hinder wheels. A long trail of glory followed after
her, and mingled with the dust; it was the emanation of
Divinity, luminous with love and beauty, like the splendour
of the setting sun; but it told me that the sun of
my joys was sunk for ever. Yes, here in the depths of
an eternal dungeon, in the nursing cradle of hell, the
suburbs of perdition, in a nest of demons, where despair
in vain sits brooding over the putrid eggs of hope; where
agony woos the embrace of death; where patience, beside
the bottomless pool of despondency, sits angling for
impossibilities. Yet, even <em>here</em>, to behold her, to embrace
her! Yes, Matilda, whether in this dark abode, amidst
toads and spiders, or in a royal palace, amidst the more
loathsome reptiles of a court, would be indifferent to me;
angels would shower down their hymns of gratulation
upon our heads, while fiends would envy the eternity of
suffering love.... Soft, what air was that? it
seemed a sound of more than human warblings. Again!
[<em>listens attentively for some minutes.</em>] Only the wind; it is
well, however; it reminds me of that melancholy air,
which has so often solaced the hours of my captivity.
Let me see whether the damps of this dungeon have not
yet injured my guitar. [<em>Takes his guitar, tunes it, and
begins the following air, with a full accompaniment of violins
from the orchestra.</em></p>

<p class='c041'>[<em>During the last stanza</em> <span class='sc'>Rogero</span> <em>dashes his head repeatedly
against the walls of his prison; and,
finally, so hard as to produce a visible contusion;
he then throws himself on the floor in an agony.
The curtain drops; the music still continuing to
play till it is wholly fallen.</em></p>

<p class='c009'>[The character of <span class='sc'>Rogero</span> is a quiz upon <span class='sc'>Sir Robert Adair</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>who received his education at Göttingen, and fell in love with
his tutor’s daughter. His relative, <span class='sc'>Lord Albemarle</span>, says in
his <em>Reminiscences</em>: “Throughout life my kinsman was an enthusiastic
admirer of the fair sex, which he generally ‘loved, not
wisely, but too well’”. He married, in 1805, Mdlle. Angélique
Gabrielle, daughter of the Marquis d’Hazincourt and the Comtesse
de Champagne.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Adair</span> was the son of Mr. Robert Adair, sergeant-surgeon to
K. George III., by his wife <span class='sc'>Lady Caroline Keppel</span>, daughter
of Wm. Anne, second Earl of Albemarle. He was educated at
Westminster School and Göttingen University; called to the
Bar, but never practised. He contested Camelford in 1796;
and was M.P. for Appleby, 1799–1802, for Camelford, 1802–1812.
He was sent by <span class='sc'>Fox</span> as Minister Plenipotentiary to Vienna in
1806; and by his old adversary <span class='sc'>Canning</span> to Constantinople in
1808; and also to Berlin. He was Ambassador to Constantinople,
1809–11, and to Belgium, 1831–5. He was a facile writer,
and wrote several spirited pamphlets, including defences of his
relatives, Francis, Duke of Bedford, and Admiral Keppel, Fox,
and other Whigs. He contributed to the <cite>Political Eclogues</cite> a
poem called <cite>Margaret Nicholson</cite>, in which George III., Pitt,
Jenkinson, &amp;c., were ridiculed, and the <cite>Song of Scrutina</cite> (on the
“Westminster Scrutiny”), in the style of Ossian, in the <cite>Probationary
Odes for the Laureateship</cite>. He was the author also of an
account of his <cite>Mission to the Court of Vienna</cite>; and his <cite>Negotiations
for the Peace of the Dardanelles</cite>: 3 vols., 8vo. For his services
in the latter business he was made G.C.B. He was born
24th May, 1763, and died 3rd Oct., 1855.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is a curious circumstance connected with the composition
of this song, the first five stanzas of which were written
by <span class='sc'>Canning</span>. Having been accidentally seen, previous to its
publication, by <span class='sc'>Pitt</span>, who was cognisant of the proceedings of
the “Anti-Jacobin” writers, he was so amused with it, that he
took up a pen and composed the last stanza on the spot.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

26, 1811, with alterations and additions, and some introductory

  <h2 class='c005'>No. XXXI.</h2>
</div>

<div class='c040'>June 11, 1798.</div>

<p class='c009'>We have received, in the course of the last week,
several long, and to say the truth, dull letters, from
unknown hands, reflecting in very severe terms on <span class='sc'>Mr.
Higgins</span>, for having, as it is affirmed, attempted to pass
upon the world, as a faithful sample of the productions
of the German theatre, a performance no way resembling
any of those pieces which have so late excited, and
which bid fair to engross, the admiration of the British
public.</p>

<p class='c009'>As we cannot but consider ourselves as the guardians
of <span class='sc'>Mr. Higgins’s</span> literary reputation, in respect to every
work of his which is conveyed to the world through the
medium of our paper (though, what we think of the
danger of his principles we have already sufficiently
explained for ourselves, and have, we trust, succeeded in
putting our readers upon their guard against them)—we
hold ourselves bound not only to justify the fidelity of
the imitation, but (contrary to our original intention)
to give a further specimen of it in our present number, in
order to bring the question more fairly to issue between
our author and his calumniators.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the first place we are to observe, that <span class='sc'>Mr. Higgins</span>
professes to have taken his notion of German plays
wholly from the translations which have appeared in our
language. If <em>they</em> are totally dissimilar from the originals,
Mr. H. may undoubtedly have been led into error; but
the fault is in the translators, not in him. That he does
not differ widely from the models which he proposed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>himself, we have it in our power to prove satisfactorily,
and might have done so in our last number, by subjoining
to each particular passage of his play the scene in
some one or other of the German plays which he had in
view when he wrote it. These parallel passages were
faithfully pointed out to us by Mr. H. with that candour
which marks his character; and if they were suppressed
by us (as in truth they were), on our heads be the blame,
whatever it may be. Little, indeed, did we think of the
imputation which the omission would bring upon Mr. H.,
as in fact our principal reason for it was the apprehension
that, from the extreme closeness of the imitation in most
instances, he would lose in praise for invention more than
he would gain in credit for fidelity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The meeting between Matilda and Cecilia, for example,
in the first act of <cite>The Rovers</cite>, and their sudden intimacy,
has been censured as unnatural. Be it so. It is taken,
<em>almost word for word</em>, from <cite>Stella</cite>, a German (or professedly
a German) piece now much in vogue; from which also the
catastrophe of <span class='sc'>Mr. Higgins’s</span> play is in part borrowed,
so far as relates to the agreement to which the ladies
come, as the reader will see by and bye, to share Casimere
between them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dinner-scene is copied partly from the published
translation of <cite>The Stranger</cite>, and partly from the first
scene of <cite>Stella</cite>. The song of Rogero, with which the
first act concludes, is admitted on all hands to be in the
very first taste; and if no German original is to be
found for it, so much the worse for the credit of German
literature.</p>

<p class='c009'>An objection has been made by one anonymous letter-writer
to the names of Puddingfield and Beefington, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>little likely to have been assigned to English characters
by any author of taste or discernment. In answer to
this objection we have, in the first place, to admit, that
a small, and we hope not an unwarrantable, alteration
has been made by us since the MS. has been in our
hands. These names stood originally Puddincrantz and
Beefinstern, which sounded to our ears as being liable,
especially the latter, to a ridiculous inflection—a difficulty
that could only be removed by furnishing them
with English terminations. With regard to the more
substantial syllables of the names, our author proceeded,
in all probability, on the authority of Goldoni, who,
though not a German, is an Italian writer of considerable
reputation; and who, having heard that the English
were distinguished for their love of liberty and beef, has
judiciously compounded the two words <em>Runnymede</em> and
<em>Beef</em>, and thereby produced an English nobleman, whom
he styles <em>Lord Runnybeef</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>To dwell no longer on particular passages, the best
way perhaps of explaining the whole scope and view of
Mr. H.’s imitation will be to transcribe the short sketch
of the plot which that gentleman transmitted to us,
together with his drama, and which it is perhaps the
more necessary to give at length, as, the limits of our
paper not allowing of the publication of the whole piece,
some general knowledge of its main design may be
acceptable to our readers, in order to enable them to
judge of the several extracts which we lay before them.</p>

<h3 class='c031'>PLOT.</h3>

<p class='c034'>Rogero, son of the late minister of the Count of Saxe Weimar,
having while he was at college, fallen desperately in love
with Matilda Pottingen, daughter of his tutor, Doctor Engelbertus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Pottingen, Professor of Civil Law; and Matilda evidently
returning his passion, the Doctor, to prevent ill consequences,
sends his daughter on a visit to her aunt in Wetteravia, where
she becomes acquainted with Casimere, a Polish Officer, who
happens to be quartered near her aunt’s, and has several children
by him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roderic, Count of Saxe Weimar, a prince of a tyrannical and
licentious disposition, has for his Prime Minister and favourite
Gaspar, a crafty villain, who had risen to his post by first ruining,
and then putting to death, Rogero’s father. Gaspar,
apprehensive of the power and popularity which the young
Rogero may enjoy at his return to Court, seizes the occasion of
his intrigue with Matilda (of which he is apprized officially by
Doctor Pottingen) to procure from his master an order for the
recall of Rogero from college, and for committing him to the
care of the Prior of the Abbey of Quedlinburgh, a priest,
rapacious, savage, and sensual, and devoted to Gaspar’s interests—sending
at the same time private orders to the Prior to confine
him in a dungeon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here Rogero languishes many years. His daily sustenance
is administered to him through a grated opening at the top of
a cavern, by the landlady of the Golden Eagle at Weimar, with
whom Gaspar contracts, in the prince’s name, for his support;
intending, and more than once endeavouring, to corrupt the
waiter to mingle poison with the food, in order that he may get
rid of Rogero for ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime, Casimere, having been called away from
the neighbourhood of Matilda’s residence to other quarters,
becomes enamoured of and marries Cecilia, by whom he has
a family; and whom he likewise deserts after a few years’ cohabitation,
on pretence of business which calls him to Kamtschatka.</p>

<p class='c009'>Doctor Pottingen, now grown old and infirm, and feeling the
want of his daughter’s society, sends young Pottingen in search
of her, with strict injunctions not to return without her; and
to bring with her either her present lover Casimere, or, should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>that not be possible, Rogero himself, if he can find him; the
Doctor having set his heart upon seeing his children comfortably
settled before his death. Matilda, about the same period,
quits her aunt’s in search of Casimere; and Cecilia, having been
advertised (by an anonymous letter) of the falsehood of his
Kamtschatka journey, sets out in the post-waggon on a similar
pursuit.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is at this point of time the Play opens—with the accidental
meeting of Cecilia and Matilda at the Inn at Weimar. Casimere
arrives there soon after, and falls in first with Matilda, and then
with Cecilia. Successive <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclaircissements</span></i> take place, and an
arrangement is finally made, by which the two ladies are to live
jointly with Casimere.</p>

<p class='c009'>Young Pottingen, wearied with a few weeks’ search, during
which he has not been able to find either of the objects of it,
resolves to stop at Weimar, and wait events there. It so
happens that he takes up his lodgings in the same house with
Puddingfield and Beefington, two English noblemen, whom the
tyranny of King John has obliged to fly from their country;
and who, after wandering about the continent for some time,
have fixed their residence at Weimar.</p>

<p class='c009'>The news of the signature of Magna Charta arriving, determines
Puddingfield and Beefington to return to England.
Young Pottingen opens his case to them, and entreats them to
stay to assist him in the object of his search.—This they refuse;
but coming to the Inn where they are to set off for Hamburgh,
they meet Casimere, from whom they had both received many
civilities in Poland.</p>

<p class='c009'>Casimere, by this time tired of his “<span class='sc'>Double Arrangement</span>,”
and having learnt from the waiter that Rogero is confined in
the vaults of the neighbouring abbey <em>for love</em>, resolves to attempt
his rescue, and to make over Matilda to him as the price of his
deliverance. He communicates his scheme to Puddingfield and
Beefington, who agree to assist him; as also does young Pottingen.
The Waiter of the Inn, proving to be a <em>Knight Templar</em>
in disguise, is appointed leader of the expedition. A band of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Troubadours, who happen to be returning from the Crusades,
and a company of Austrian and Prussian Grenadiers returning
from the Seven Years’ War, are engaged as troops.</p>

<p class='c009'>The attack on the Abbey is made with success. The Count
of Weimar and Gaspar, who are feasting with the Prior, are
seized and beheaded in the refectory. The Prior is thrown into
the dungeon from which Rogero is rescued. Matilda and
Cecilia rush in. The former recognises Rogero, and agrees to
live with him. The children are produced on all sides—and
young Pottingen is commissioned to write to his father, the
Doctor, to detail the joyful events which have taken place, and
to invite him to Weimar to partake of the general felicity.</p>

her appearance—the fineness of the weather—all conspired
to interest me—my heart moved to hers—as if by
magnetic sympathy. We wept, embraced, and went

<div class='c033'>June 25, 1798.</div>

<p class='c007'>After the splendid account of <span class='sc'>Buonaparte’s</span> successes
in the East, which our readers will find in another part
of this paper,<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c024'><sup>[292]</sup></a> and which they will peruse with equal
wonder and apprehension, it is some consolation to us to
have to state, not only from authority, but in verse, that
our government has not been behindhand with that of
France; but that aware of the wise and enterprising
spirit of the enemy, and of the danger which might arise
to our distant possessions from the export of learning and
learned men being entirely in their hands, ministers have
long ago determined on an expedition of a similar nature,
and have actually embarked at Portsmouth on board one
of the East India Company’s ships taken up for that
purpose (the ship <em>Capricorn</em>, Mr. Thomas Truman, Commander),
several tons of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">savans</span></i>, the growth of this
country. The whole was conducted with the utmost
secrecy and dispatch, and it was not till we were favoured
with the following copy of a letter (obligingly communicated
to us by the Tunisian gentleman to whom it is
addressed) that we had any suspicion of the extent and
nature of the design, or indeed of any such design being
in contemplation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>The several great names which are combined to render
this Expedition the most surprising and splendid ever
undertaken, could not indeed have been spared from the
country to which they are an ornament for any other
purpose than one the most obviously connected with
the interests of the empire, and the most widely beneficial
to mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The secrecy with which they have been withdrawn
from the British public, without being so much as missed
or enquired after, reflects the highest honour on the
planners of the enterprise. Even the celebrity of <span class='sc'>Doctor
Parr</span> has not led to any discovery or investigation: the
silent admirers of that great man have never once
thought of asking what was become of him; till it is now
all at once come to light, that he has been for weeks past
on shipboard, the brightest star in the bright constellation
of talents which stud the quarter-deck of the <em>Capricorn</em>,
Mr. T. Truman (as before mentioned), Commander.</p>

<p class='c007'>The resignation of the late worthy President of a
certain Agricultural Board<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c024'><sup>[293]</sup></a> might indeed have taught
mankind to look for some extraordinary event in the
world of science and adventure; and those who had the
good fortune to see the deportation from his house, of the
several wonderful anomalies which had for years formed
its most distinguished inmates,—the stuffed ram, the
dried boar, the cow with three horns, and other fanciful
productions of a like nature, could not but speculate with
some degree of seriousness on the purpose of their removal,
and on the place of their destination.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>It now appears that there was in truth no light object
in view. They were destined, with the rest of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">savans</span></i>,
on whom this country prides itself (and long may it have
reason to indulge the honest exultation), to undertake a
voyage of no less grandeur than peril; to counteract the
designs of the Directory, and to frustrate or forestal the
conquests of Buonaparte.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young gentleman who writes the following letter
to his friend in London is, as may be seen, interpreter to
the Expedition. We have understood, further, that he is
connected with the young man who writes for the
<cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, and conducts the <em>Critical, Argumentative</em>,
and <em>Geographical</em> departments. Some say it is the
young man himself, who has assumed a feigned name,
and, under the disguise of a Turkish dress and circumcision,
is gone, at the express instigation of his employers,
to improve himself in geographical knowledge.
We have our doubts upon this subject, as we think we
recognise the style of this deplorable young man in an
article of last week’s <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, which we have
had occasion to answer in a preceding column of our
present paper. Be that as it may, the information contained
in the following letter may be depended upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>We cannot take leave of the subject without remarking
what a fine contrast and companion the vessel and cargo
described in the following poem affords [<em>sic</em>] to the “<span class='sc'>Navis
Stultifera</span>,” the “<span class='sc'>Shippe of Fooles</span>” of the celebrated
<span class='sc'>Barclay</span>; and we cannot forbear hoping that the <em>Argenis</em>
of an author of the same name may furnish a hint for an
account of this stupendous Expedition in a learned
language, from the only pen which in modern days is
capable of writing Latin with a purity and elegance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>worthy of so exalted a theme, and that the author of a
classical <em>preface</em><a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c024'><sup>[294]</sup></a> may become the writer of a no less
celebrated voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>We deeply regret this interruption of our oriental poet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>and the more so, as the prose letters which we have received
from a less learned correspondent do not enable
us to explain the tactics of our belligerent philosophers
so distinctly as we could have wished. It appears, in
general, that the learned Doctor who has the honour of
sharing the hammock of the amiable oriental, trusted
principally to his superior knowledge in the Greek
language, by means of which he hoped to entangle his
antagonists in inextricable confusion. <span class='sc'>Dr. Darwin</span> proposed
(as might be expected) his celebrated experiment
of the Ice-island,<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c024'><sup>[298]</sup></a> which, being towed on the coast of
Africa, could not fail of spoiling the climate, and immediately
terrifying and embarrassing the sailors of
Buonaparte’s fleet, accustomed to the mild temperature
and gentle gales of the Mediterranean, and therefore ill
qualified to struggle with this new importation of
tempests. <span class='sc'>Dr. Beddoes</span> was satisfied with the project
of communicating to Buonaparte a consumption, of the
same nature with that which he formerly tried on himself,
but superior in virulence, and therefore calculated to
make the most rapid and fatal ravages in the hectic constitution
of the Gallic hero. The rest of the plan is quite
unintelligible, excepting a hint about Sir J. S.’s intention
of proceeding with his ram to the celebrated Oasis, and
of bringing away, for the convenience of the Bank, the
treasures contained in the temple of Jupiter Ammon.</p>

<p class='c034'>The Priority of Intelligence which has ever distinguished <span class='sc'>Our Paper</span> will,
We trust, receive additional lustre from the extraordinary News which We now
lay before the Public. We received it by a Neutral Ship, which arrived in the

Correspondent, a Currant Merchant at <em>Zanté</em>, for its early communication.
Without arrogating to ourselves that merit which is (perhaps) justly our due,
We think ourselves justified in asserting that it is not only the earliest, but,
if We are not much mistaken, the only account which will appear in the Prints

<p class='c009'>“The brave Soldiers, who conferred Liberty on <em>Rome</em>, have continued
to deserve well of their Country. <em>Greece</em> has joyfully received her
Deliverers. The Tree of Liberty is planted on the <em>Piræus</em>. Thirty thousand
Janizaries, the Slaves of Despotism, had taken possession of the Isthmus of
<em>Corinth</em>. Two Demi-brigades opened us a passage. After ten days’ fighting,
we have driven the <em>Turks</em> from the <em>Morea</em>. The <em>Peloponnesus</em> is now free.
Every step in my power has been taken to revive the antient spirit of <em>Sparta</em>.
The Inhabitants of that celebrated City, seeing <em>black broth</em> of my Troops, and
the scarcity of specie to which we have been long accustomed, will, I doubt not,
soon acquire the frugal virtues of their Ancestors. As a proper measure of
precaution, I have removed all <span class='sc'>Pitt’s</span> gold from the Country.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Off this Island we encountered the Fleet of the <span class='sc'>Sultan</span>. The Mahometan
Crescent soon fled before the three-coloured flag. Nine Sail of the
Line are the fruits of this Victory. The <span class='sc'>Captain Pacha’s</span> Ship, a second rate,
struck to a National Corvette. My Aide-de-Camp will present you with the
model of a <em>Trireme</em>, which was found among the Archives of <em>Athens</em>. Vessels of
this description draw so little water, that our Naval Architects may perhaps
think them more eligible than Rafts, for the conveyance of the <em>Army of England</em>.
Liberty will be sufficiently avenged, if the ruins of a Grecian City furnish us
with the means of transporting the Conquerors of <em>Rome</em> to <em>Britain</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“On landing at this Island, I participated in a Scene highly interesting
to Humanity. A poor Fisherman, of the family of <span class='sc'>Themistocles</span>, attended by
his Wife, a descendant of the virtuous <span class='sc'>Phryne</span>, fell at my feet. I received him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>with the Fraternal embrace, and promised him the protection of the Republic.
He invited me to supper at his Hut, and in gratitude to his Deliverer presented
me with a memorable <em>Oyster Shell</em>, inscribed with the Name of his illustrious
Ancestor. As this curious piece of antiquity may be of service to some of the
<span class='sc'>Directory</span>, I have inclosed it in my Dispatches, together with a Marble Tablet,
containing the proper form for pronouncing the Sentence of <em>Ostracism</em> on
<em>Royalist Athenians</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Kléber</span>, whom I had ordered to <em>Constantinople</em>, informs me that the
Capital of Turkey has proved an easy conquest. <em>Santa-Sophia</em> has been converted
into a Temple of Reason; the <em>Seraglio</em> has been purified by <em>Theo-Philanthropists</em>,
and the liberated Circassians are learning from our Sailors the lessons
of Equality and Fraternity. A Detachment has been sent to Troy, for the
purpose pf organizing the Department of <em>Mount Ida</em>. The Tomb of <span class='sc'>Achilles</span>
has been repaired, and the Bust of <span class='sc'>Briseis</span> (which formed part of the Pedestal)
restored to its original state, at the expense of the Female Citizen <span class='sc'>Buonaparté</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Division of the Fleet destined for Egypt has anchored in the Port of
<em>Alexandria</em>. <span class='sc'>Berthier</span>, who commands this Expedition, informs me that this
Port will soon be restored to its ancient pre-eminence; and that its celebrated
<em>Pharos</em> will soon be fit to receive the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Reverbères</span></i> which have been sent from the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue St. Honoré</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Baraguay D’Hilliers</span>, with the Left Wing of the <em>Army of Egypt</em>, has
fixed his Head-quarters at <em>Jerusalem</em>. He is charged to restore the Jews to
their ancient Rights. Citizens Jacob Jacobs, Simon Levi, and Benjamin
Solomons, of Amsterdam, have been provisionally appointed Directors. The
Palace of <em>Pontius Pilate</em> is re-building for their residence. All the vestiges of
Superstition in <em>Palestine</em> have been carefully destroyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg you will ratify a grant which I have made of the <em>Temple of the Sun</em>
at <em>Palmyra</em> to a Society of <em>Illuminati</em> from <em>Bavaria</em>. They may be of service in
extending our future conquests.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have received very satisfactory accounts from <span class='sc'>Desaix</span>, who had been
sent by <span class='sc'>Berthier</span> with a Demi-brigade into the interior of <em>Africa</em>. That fine
Country has been too long neglected by Europeans. In manners and civilization
it much resembles France, and will soon emulate our virtues. Already
does the Torrid Zone glow with the ardour of Freedom. Already has the Altar
of Liberty been reared in the <em>Caffrarian</em> and <em>Equinoctial Republics</em>. Their
regenerated inhabitants have sworn eternal amity to us at a Civic Feast, to
which a detachment of our Army was invited. This memorable day would
have terminated with the utmost harmony, if the <span class='sc'>Caffrarian Council</span> of
<span class='sc'>Ancients</span> had not devoured the greatest part of General Desaix’s État-Major
for their supper. I hope our Ambassador will be instructed to require that
Civic Feasts of this nature be omitted for the future. The Directory of the
<em>Equinoctial Republic</em> regret that the scarcity of British Cloth in Africa, and the
great heat of the climate, prevent them from adopting our <em>costume</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We hope soon to liberate the <em>Hottentots</em>, and to drive the perfidious
<em>English</em> from the extremities of Africa and of Europe. <em>Asia</em>, too, will soon be
free. The three-coloured flag floats on the summit of Caucasus; the <em>Tigrine
Republic</em> is established; the <em>Cis</em> and <em>Trans-Euphratean Conventions</em> are assembled;
and soon shall <em>Arabia</em>, under the mild influence of <em>French Principles</em>, resume
her ancient appellation, and be again denominated ‘the <span class='sc'>Happy</span>’.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the course of the next Decade I shall sail to the Canal which is now
cutting across the <em>Isthmus of Suez</em>. The Polytechnic School and Corps of
Geographical Engineers are employed in devising means for conveying my
heavy artillery across the great Desert. Soon shall <em>India</em> hail us as her
Deliverers, and those proud islanders, the <em>Tyrants of Calcutta</em>, fall before the
<em>Heroes of Arcola</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Members of the National Institute who accompanied the Squadron to
Egypt, have made a large collection of Antiquities for the use of the Republic.
Among the scattered remains of the Alexandrine Library, they have found a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>curious Treatise, in Arabic, respecting <em>Camels</em>, from which it appears that
Human Beings, by proper treatment, may, like those useful animals, be trained
to support thirst and hunger without complaining. Many reams of papyrus
have been collected, as it is thought that during the present scarcity of linen
and old rags in France, it may answer all the purposes of paper. <span class='sc'>Cleopatra’s</span>
celebrated Obelisk has been shipped on board the Admiral’s Ship <em>L’Orient</em>,
cidevant <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sans Culottes</span></i>: Another man-of-war has been freighted with the <em>Sphinx</em>,
which our Engineers removed from <em>Grand Cairo</em>, and which, I trust, will be
thought a proper ornament for the Hall of Audience of the Directory.—The
cage in which <span class='sc'>Bajazet</span> was confined, has been long preserved at <em>Bassora</em>; it will
be transmitted to Paris as a proper model for a new <cite>Cayenne Diligence</cite>.—I beg
leave to present to the Director <span class='sc'>Merlin</span>, a very curious book, bound in Morocco
leather, from Algiers. It is finely illuminated with gold; and contains lists of
the various fees usually received by Deys and their Ministers from Foreign
Ambassadors. A broken Column will be sent from <em>Carthage</em>. It records the
downfall of that Commercial City; and is sufficiently large for an Inscription
(if the Directory should think proper to place it on the Banks of the <em>Thames</em>), to
inform posterity that it marks the spot where <em>London once stood</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Its reception with the Public has been highly favourable:—it
certainly has been out of proportion to any
merit which has appeared in the execution of the Work.
This is not said in the mere cant of Authorship. We
are sensible that much of our success has been owing to
the improved state of the Public mind;—an improvement
existing from other causes, and to which, if We
have in any degree contributed, it has in return operated
to our advantage, by a reaction more than equal to any
impression which our exertions could have produced.
There is, however, one species of merit to which We lay
claim without hesitation:—We mean that of the Spirit
and Principles upon which We have acted. That Spirit,
We trust We shall leave behind us. The <span class='fss'>SPELL</span> of <em>Jacobin

the dissemination of tenets, which, at the period to which
We allude, seemed necessary to the success of the Ruling
Party.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some time matters went on swimmingly. The
Editors of the favoured Prints divided their time and
their attention between <em>London</em> and <em>Paris</em>; and the
superiority of the governing Party in France, over its
Opponents, was as duly, and as strenuously maintained
in the English Papers, as in the “<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal du Père de
Chène</span></cite>,”<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c024'><sup>[307]</sup></a> “<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal par L’Ami du Peuple</span></cite>,”<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c024'><sup>[308]</sup></a> or any other
Journal that issued from the Presses of the Jacobin
Society.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the principles of the Revolution, however, acquired
consistency in France, the struggle between the Governing
Party and its Opponents became an object of less
moment, and the Jacobins had leisure, as they long had
had inclination, to turn their views to this Country.</p>

<p class='c007'>A State, enjoying under a Government which they had
proscribed as utterly incapable of producing either, as
much freedom and happiness as comport with the nature
of Man, was too bitter a satire on the decision of these
new <span class='sc'>Solons</span>, to be regarded with patience; and the pens
which had been so industriously employed in celebrating
the plunderers and perturbators of France, were now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>engaged in the benevolent design of recommending their
principles, and their plans of ameliorating the condition
of the human race by Atheism and Plunder, to the serious
notice of the People of <em>Great Britain</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Affairs seemed rapidly hastening to a crisis: <em>France</em>
saw with delight the numbers seduced by the sophistry
of her Writers, and by the alluring prospects of proscription
and plunder; and her Agents, who snuffed the scent
of blood like Vultures, already anticipated the Revolution
which they now believed inevitable; when the Ministry,
who had viewed the progress of the evil with an anxious
but unterrified eye, roused themselves into unexampled
energy, and called on the Nation to rally round the Constitution
which they had received from their Forefathers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The call was gloriously answered;—Thousands and
tens of thousands sprung forth in its defence; and the
barbarous hordes which so lately threatened its destruction,
overawed by their numbers, shrunk from the contest
without a struggle, and vanished from the field.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the nature of a Jacobin is restless. His hatred of
all subordination is unbounded, and his thirst of plunder
and blood urgent and insatiable. In arms he found
himself infinitely too weak to obtain his purpose; he
must, therefore, have recourse again to artifice; and by
fallacies and lies, endeavoured to subvert and betray the
judgment of those he could not openly hope to subdue.</p>

<p class='c007'>For this purpose, the Press was engaged, and almost
monopolized in all its branches: Reviews, Registers,
Monthly Magazines, and Morning and Evening Prints,
sprung forth in abundance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of these last (the only Publications with which We
have any immediate concern), it is not too much to say,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>that they have laboured in the cause of infamy, with a
perseverance which no sense of shame could repress, and
no dread of punishment overcome. The objects committed
to their charge were multifarious. They were to revile
all Religions, but particularly the Christian, whose
<span class='fss'>DIVINE FOUNDER</span> was to be blasphemously compared to
<em>Bacchus</em>, and represented as equally ideal, or, if real,
more bestial and besotted! They were to magnify the
power of <em>France</em>, on all occasions; to deny her murders;
to palliate her robberies; to suppress all mention of her
miseries, and to hold her forth to the unenlightened
Englishman as the mirror of justice, and truth, and
generosity, and meekness, and humanity, and moderation,
and tender forbearance:—and, on the other hand,
they were to depreciate the spirit, and the courage, and
the resources of <em>England</em>: they were to impede, if
possible, and if not, to ridicule and revile, every measure
which the honour, the prosperity, or the safety of the
Country might imperiously require; they were to represent
the Government as insidiously aiming to enslave the
Nation, by every attempt to maintain its Independence;
and the majority of both Houses, the great body of Proprietors,
as anxious to scatter and confound that wealth,
which <em>their</em> Patrons alone, the respectable sweepings of
<em>Craven-House</em>, and the <em>Crown</em> and <em>Anchor</em> Tavern, were
solicitous to augment and preserve.</p>

<p class='c007'>These, our readers will allow, were no common objects,
and if they have looked into the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, <cite>Morning
Post</cite>, and <cite>Courier</cite> Journals to which our attention
has been chiefly directed, they must have seen that their
attainment was sought by no common means; by an
<em>invariable</em> course of Falsehood and Misrepresentation—such,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>at least, was our idea on the first perusal of these
Papers, an idea which every succeeding one served to
strengthen and confirm.</p>

<p class='c007'>To detect and expose this Falsehood, and to correct
this Misrepresentation, became at length an object of
indispensable necessity: a variety of applications of the
most malignant nature had obtained currency and credit,
from the unblushing impudence with which they were
first obtruded on the Public by the Agents of Sedition,
and the apathy with which they were suffered to pass
uncontradicted by those who despised them for their
atrocity, or ridiculed them for their folly:—these were
unfortunately operating on the less enlightened part of
the Nation; and it was from a full conviction of the
pernicious effects they were calculated to produce, that
we finally determined to step forth (after patiently
waiting to see whether the business would not be
taken up by abler hands), and to oppose such antidotes
to the evil, as a regard for truth, and a sincere
love and veneration for the Constitution under which
we have flourished for ages, could supply.</p>

<p class='c007'>How we have succeeded must be left to the judgment
of the Public. If we might venture, indeed, to conjecture
from the support which we have experienced, the result
would be flattering in an unusual degree. Three complete
Editions of our Paper (a circumstance, we believe,
as yet without a precedent) have been disposed of, and
the demand for them still increases.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the motives of Profit, as will readily, we believe,
be granted to us, have little influence on our minds: we
contemplate the extensive circulation of our Paper with
pleasure, solely from the consideration of the <span class='fss'>VAST
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>NUMBERS</span> of our Countrymen whom we have fortified
by our animadversions against the profligate attacks of
the Agents of Sedition, whether furnished by the <em>Whig
Club</em>, the <em>Corresponding Society</em>, or the <em>Directory of France</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Calculation was not originally our delight. Nor was it
till after we saw the wonderful effects which it produced
in the pages of the Jacobinical Arithmeticians that we
were tempted to adopt it. Our first Essay, however,
was crowned with the most complete success. In our
Seventh Number, we gave (still following the laudable
example of the Jacobins, who, when a Ship is to be
fitted out, or a Regiment raised, for the purpose of
defending our Country from an insolent and barbarous
foe, nicely calculate how many idle mouths might be
fed by the sums required)—We gave, we say, as accurate
a statement as we could form, of the number of People
that might be supplied with wholesome food for one day,
by the <span class='fss'>SURCHARGE</span> levied on the <span class='sc'>Duke of Bedford</span>—a
statement which, we are happy to add, placed the
matter in so clear a light that we have since had no
occasion to repeat it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our Readers will not <em>now</em> be surprised if we again have
recourse to <em>Calculation</em> to prove the advantages which (we
love to flatter ourselves) have been derived from our Paper.
Our Sale (to say nothing of the new Editions which have
been disposed of) has regularly amounted to <em>Two Thousand
Five Hundred</em> a week; on an average of several Papers,
we find the Lies which have been detected to amount to
<em>six</em>, and the Misrepresentations and Mistakes to <em>an equal
number</em>. This furnishes a total of <em>twelve</em>, which, multiplied
by <em>thirty-five</em>, the number of the last <span class='sc'>Anti-Jacobin</span>,
gives a total of <em>four hundred and twenty</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>If we now take the number of Subscribers (2500) and
multiply them by seven, a number of which every one’s
family may be reasonably supposed to consist, we shall
have a product of 17,500; but as many of these have
made a practice, which we highly approve, and cannot
too earnestly recommend, of lending our Papers to their
poorer Neighbours, We must make our addition to the
sum which We evidently take too low at 32,500. We
have thus an aggregate of 50,000 People, a most respectable
minority of the Readers of the whole Kingdom,
who have been put effectually on their guard, by our
humble though earnest endeavours, against the artifices
of the seditious, and the more open attacks of the profligate
and abandoned Foes of their Constitution, their
Country, and their God.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further, if we multiply 50,000, the number of Readers,
by 420, the exact number of Falsehoods detected—say 500—for
We ought to take in bye-blows, and odd refutations
in notes, &amp;c.—the total of Twenty-five Millions will represent
the aggregate of Falsehood which We have sent
out of the World.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have more than once repeated that we entered
upon this part of our task, not from any vain hope of
convincing the Writers themselves. We knew this to
be impossible; the forehead of a <em>Jacobin</em>, like the shield
of <span class='sc'>Ajax</span>, is formed of seven bull-hides, and utterly incapable
of any impression of shame or remorse—but we
are convinced that we have rescued, as we stated above,
Fifty Thousand persons from their machinations, and
taught them not only a salutary distrust, but a contempt
and disbelief, of every laboured article which
appears in the Papers of this description.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Nor can We be accused of presumption in this declaration,
when it is considered that the conviction on which
We so confidently rely is not the effect of a <em>solitary</em>
impression on our Readers’ minds, but of one four
hundred and twenty times repeated (this being the fair
amount of the number of Lies, &amp;c., We have detected)—an
agglomeration of impulse which no prejudice could
resist and no preconceived partialities weaken or remove.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here then We rest. We trust We have “done the
State some service”;—We have driven the Jacobins
from many strongholds to which they most tenaciously
held.<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c024'><sup>[309]</sup></a> We have exposed their Principles, detected their
Motives, weakened their Authority, and overthrown
their Credit. We have shewn them in every instance,
ignorant, and designing, and false, and wicked, and
turbulent, and anarchical—various in their language,
but united in their plans, and steadily pursuing through
hatred and contempt, the destruction of their Country.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this impression on the Minds of our Readers <span class='sc'>We
take our leave</span> of them. Their welfare is in their own
hands; if they suffer the Jacobins to regain any of the
influence of which We have deprived them, they will
compromise their own Safety; but <span class='sc'>We</span> shall be blameless—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liberavimus
animas nostras</span></i>.—<span class='sc'>We have done our
DUTY.</span></p>

<h3 class='c031'>FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p class='c043'>In the last Address which We shall have to make to
the Public, We would willingly review the whole of
what has been advanced by Us under the different Heads
of our Paper, and leave behind us a Summary of our
Opinions upon the state of each subject as We found it,
and as We conceive it to stand at the moment when our
labours are concluded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon no point, if We are to speak our sincere opinion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>is the task more easily to be executed, or in a less compass,
than in what relates to Foreign Politics.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other times, the relations of States to each other
have been matter of great study, and difficulty; have
been embarrassed with a diversity of views, and a complication
of interests, which it might require much experience
to calculate, and much political sagacity to
reconcile.</p>

<p class='c007'>At present, there is but one relation among all the
States of Europe:—one, at least, there is so paramount,
as to confound and swallow up all inferior considerations.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>France is bent on the conquest and ruin of them
all.</span> To repel this Conquest, to ward off this ruin, various
means are tried, according to the power or the prudence
of the different Nations. War, Treaty, Supplication,
Bribery, timid Neutrality, implicit Submission, and,
finally, an Incorporation into the Map of the <em>Great Republic</em>,
are all at this moment exemplified in the conduct
of the Countries which surround us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our lot, a lot imposed upon us by necessity, but which
if it were not so imposed upon us, whoever is not blind,
judicially blind to the conduct of <em>France</em> towards us, and
every other Country, would claim by choice, is <span class='sc'>War</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The relation in which we may stand to the other States
of Europe, or they to each other, is comparatively of
little moment. They may reciprocate Missions, and
propose Treaties,—the <em>Ligurian Republic</em> may make Peace
or War with the <em>Cisalpine</em>; the <em>Cisalpine</em> with the <em>Roman</em>;—either
of them with the <span class='sc'>King</span> of <span class='sc'>Sardinia</span>, with <em>Tuscany</em>,
or with <em>Naples</em>; and the greater Powers may mediate, or
embroil the quarrel, may offer their protection, and talk
of their Dignity:—But the question does not lie there.—<em>France</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>has the power and the will to controul, to oppress
them altogether; to limit or extend their Boundaries,
as she sees good; to approve or annul their Internal
Regulations, as well as their stipulations with each other:
And while she has that power, whether it be by strength
in herself, or by the sufferance of others; whether she
may choose to vex and harass them in mass, or detail;
to keep peace between them, or to set them at variance;
to work their revolutions by her own arms, or to delegate
that sacred office to their neighbours; or, finally, to
insist upon their performing it each for themselves;—the
result to us is the same. The People of Europe are
equally enslaved;—it matters not whether they are
manacled separately, or bolted to the links of a long
chain which connects and coerces them in a fellowship
of misery.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>To Us, the relation of these unhappy Powers, is either
that of Friends forced into a Foreign Army to fight
against us, or placed, hand-cuffed, on the Deck of a Line
of Battle Ship to receive our fire—or it is that of a
Captive languishing in a Dungeon against which We
are making an attack, and who does not dare to acknowledge
his Friend, till he can hail him as his Deliverer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Contest between <em>Great Britain</em> and <em>France</em>, then,
is not for the existence of the former only, but for the
Freedom of the World. To look to partial Interests, to
talk of partial Successes, as bearing upon the main object
and general issue of the War, is to take a narrow and
pitiful view of the most momentous and most tremendous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>subject that ever was brought under the consideration of
mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>If <em>Great Britain</em>, insensible of what she owes to herself
and to the World, flinches (for she <em>cannot fall</em>), in the
Contest;—she throws away not herself alone, but the
peace and happiness of Nations. If she maintain herself
stoutly;—to speculate on the mode, the time, the
means by which success adequate to the immensity of
the object at stake is to be attained, were, indeed, presumptuous;—but
We risk, without apprehension of
being thought sanguine in our hopes and expectations, or
of being contradicted by the event, the sentiment of the
greatest Orator of ancient times—“It is not, it cannot
be possible, that an Empire founded on injustice, on
rapacity, on perfidy, on the contempt and disregard of
everything sacred towards God, or among Men;—it is
not possible that such an Empire should endure.”</p>

<h3 class='c038'><span class='sc'>Joseph Priestley</span>, LL.D. (page <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>).</h3>

<p class='c043'>“I have read a communication from <span class='sc'>George III.</span> to one of his ministers, on
the subject of the riots in which <span class='sc'>Priestley’s</span> house was burned. <span class='sc'>His Majesty</span>
says, in his short emphatic way, that the riots must be stopped <em>immediately</em>;
that no man’s house must be left in peril; and then he orders the march of
certain troops, &amp;c., to restore peace; and concludes with saying that, as the
mischief did occur, it was impossible not to be pleased at its having fallen on
<span class='sc'>Priestley</span> rather than another, that he might <em>feel</em> the wickedness of the doctrines
of democracy which he was propagating.”—<em>J. W. Croker</em> (<em>MS.</em>).—[<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<h3 class='c031'><span class='sc'>Madame de Stael</span> (page <a href='#Page_282'>282</a>).</h3>

<p class='c043'>“<span class='sc'>Madame de Stael</span> was at Mickleham, in Surrey, in 1793, with Talleyrand,
Narbonne, Jaucourt, Guibert (who proposed to her), and others. There was
not a little scandal about her relations with Narbonne (see Fanny Burney’s
Letters). Narbonne’s place was supplied by Benjamin Constant, who had a
very great influence over her, as in return she had over him. At Coppet, she
found consolation in a young officer of Swiss origin, named Rocca, twenty-three
years her junior, whom she married privately in 1811. She had married Baron
de Stael in 1786, and in 1797 they separated. He died in 1802; and she in 1817.”—<cite>Life
of Mad. de Stael, by A. Stevens</cite>, 1880.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the 28th of January” (says Crabb Robinson in his <cite>Diary</cite>, 1804), “I first
waited on <span class='sc'>Madame de Stael</span>. I was shown into her bedroom, for which, not
knowing Parisian customs, I was unprepared. She was sitting, most decorously,
in her bed, and writing. She had her night-cap on, and her face was not made
up for the day. It was by no means a captivating spectacle, but I had a very
cordial reception, and two bright black eyes smiled benignantly on me. After
a warm expression of her pleasure at making my acquaintance, she dismissed
me till three o’clock. On my return then I found a very different person——the
accomplished Frenchwoman surrounded by admirers, some of whom were
themselves distinguished. Among them was the aged <span class='sc'>Wieland</span>. There was
on this, and, I believe, on almost every other, occasion, but one lady among
the guests: in this instance <span class='sc'>Frau von Kalb</span>. <span class='sc'>Madame de Stael</span> did not affect
to conceal her preference for the society of men to that of her own sex.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Count d’Orsay</span> related of <span class='sc'>Madame de Stael</span>, whose character was discussed,
that one day, being on a sofa with <span class='sc'>Madame de Récamier</span>, one who
placed himself between them exclaimed: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Me voilà entre la beauté et l’esprit!</span>”
She replied: “That is the first time I was ever complimented for beauty!”
<span class='sc'>Madame de Récamier</span> was thought the handsomest woman in Paris, but was
by no means famed for <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i>.—<cite>Crabb Robinson’s Diary.</cite></p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Madame de Stael</span> was a perfect aristocrat, and her sympathies were
wholly with the great and prosperous. She saw nothing in England but the
luxury, stupidity, and pride of the Tory aristocracy, and the intelligence and
magnificence of the Whig aristocracy. The latter talked about truth and
liberty and herself, and she supposed it was all as it should be. As to the
millions, the people, she never enquired into their situation. She had a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>horror of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</span></i>, but anything of <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">sangre azul</span></i> had a charm for her. When
she was dying she said; ‘Let me die in peace; let my last moments be undisturbed’.
Yet she ordered the cards of every visitor to be brought to her.
Among them was one from the <span class='sc'>Duc de Richelieu</span>. ‘What!’ exclaimed she,
indignantly; ‘what! have you sent away the <span class='sc'>Duke</span>? Hurry. Fly after him.
Bring him back. Tell him that though I die for all the world, I live for <em>him</em>.’”—<cite>Bowring’s
Autobr. Recollections</cite>, pp. 375–6.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Madame de Stael</span> prepared her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bons-mots</span></i> with elaborate care, some being
borrowed.... She was ugly, and not of an intellectual ugliness. Her
features were coarse, and the ordinary expression rather vulgar. She had an
ugly mouth, and one or two irregularly prominent teeth, which perhaps gave
her countenance an habitual gaiety. Her eye was full, dark, and expressive;
and when she declaimed, which was almost whenever she spoke, she looked
eloquent, and one forgot that she was plain. On the whole, she was singularly
unfeminine; and if, in conversation, one forgot she was ugly, one forgot also
that she was a woman.—<cite>J. W. Croker’s Note-Books.</cite>—[<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<h3 class='c031'><span class='sc'>The Rev. Gilbert Wakefield</span> (page <a href='#Page_284'>284</a>).</h3>

<p class='c043'>“It is well known that the French Revolution turned the brains of many of
the noblest youths in England. Indeed when such men as <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span>, <span class='sc'>Wordsworth</span>,
<span class='sc'>Southey</span>, caught the infection, no wonder that those who partook of
their sensibility, but had a very small portion of their intellect, were carried
away. Many were ruined by the errors into which they were betrayed; many
also lived to smile at the follies of their youth. ‘I am no more ashamed of
having been a Republican,’ said <span class='sc'>Southey</span>, ‘than I am of having been a child.’
The opinions held led to many political prosecutions, and I naturally had
much sympathy with the sufferers. I find in my journal, Feb. 21, 1799 (says
Crabb Robinson): ‘An interesting and memorable day. It was the day on
which <span class='sc'>Gilbert Wakefield</span> was convicted of a seditious libel, and sentenced
to two years’ imprisonment. This he suffered in Dorchester Gaol, which he
left only to die. Originally of the Established Church, he became a Unitarian,
and Professor at the Hackney College. By profession he was a scholar. His
best known work was an edition of Lucretius. He had written against <span class='sc'>Porson’s</span>
edition of the <cite>Hecuba</cite> of Euripides.’ It is said that <span class='sc'>Porson</span> was at a dinner-party
at which toasts were going round, and a name, accompanied by an appropriate
sentence from Shakespeare, was required from each of the guests in succession.
Before <span class='sc'>Porson’s</span> turn came, he had disappeared beneath the table,
and was supposed to be insensible to what was going on. This, however, was
not the case, for when a toast was required of him, he staggered up and gave:
‘Gilbert Wakefield—what’s <cite>Hecuba</cite> to him, or he to <cite>Hecuba</cite>?’ <span class='sc'>Wakefield</span> was
a political fanatic. He had the pale complexion and mild features of a Saint,
was a most gentle creature in domestic life, and a very amiable man; but when
he took part in any religious or political controversy, his pen was dipped in
gall. The occasion of the imprisonment before alluded to was a letter in reply
to <span class='sc'>Watson</span>, Bishop of Llandaff, who had written a pamphlet exhorting the
people to loyalty. <span class='sc'>Wakefield</span> asserted that the poor, the labouring classes;
could lose nothing by French conquest. Referring to the fable of the Ass and
the Trumpeter, he said: ‘Will the enemy make me carry two panniers?’ and
declared that, if the French came, they would find him at his post with the

</div>

<p class='c043'>The following remarkable account of this scientific monster is given in an
“Historical Account of the Warrington Academy, an institution in Lancashire,”
published in the <cite>Monthly Repository</cite>, by the Rev. W. Turner, of Wakefield.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After the departure of <span class='sc'>Dr. Reinhold Forster</span>, various unsuccessful
attempts were made to engage a foreigner in the capacity of teacher of the
modern languages—a <span class='sc'>M. Fantin la Tour</span>, a <span class='sc'>M. le Maitre</span>, <em>alias</em> <span class='sc'>Mara</span>, and a
<span class='sc'>Mr. Lewis Guery</span>; but none of them continued for any length of time....
There is great reason to believe that <span class='sc'>le Maitre</span>, <em>alias</em> <span class='sc'>Mara</span>, was the infamous
<span class='sc'>Marat</span>.... It is known that he was in England about this time [1774], and
published in London “A Philosophical Essay on the connection between the
Body and the Soul of Man,” and, somewhere in the country, had a principal
hand in printing, in quarto, a work of considerable ability, but of a seditious
tendency, entitled—‘<cite>The Chains of Slavery: a work wherein the clandestine and
villainous Attempts of Princes to ruin Liberty are pointed out, and the dreadful
Scenes of Despotism disclosed, etc.; London, sold by J. Almon.... T. Payne,
and Richardson and Urquhart, 1774.</cite>’ <span class='sc'>Mara</span>, as his name is spelt in the
Minutes of the Academy, very soon left Warrington, whence he went to Oxford,
robbed the Ashmolean Museum, escaped to Ireland, was apprehended in
Dublin, tried and convicted in Oxford, under the name of <span class='sc'>le Maitre</span>, and
sentenced to the hulks at Woolwich. Here one of his old pupils at Warrington,
a native of Bristol, saw him. He was afterwards a Bookseller in Bristol, and
failed; was confined in the gaol of that city, but released by the Society there
for the relief of prisoners confined for small sums. One of that society, who
had previously relieved him in Bristol Gaol, afterwards saw him in the National
Assembly in Paris in 1792.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Grave doubts have, however, been thrown upon the accuracy of the above
statement by <span class='sc'>Henry A. Bright</span>, B.A., in a paper published in the <cite>Transactions
of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire</cite>, 8vo, vol. xi., session 1858–9. Yet
it was an establishment that might have attracted such a mind as Marat’s.
“At <span class='sc'>Warrington Academy</span> (says Mr. Bright), were collected some of the
noblest <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">literati</span></i> of their day. Here the free thought of the English Presbyterians
first began to crystallize into the Unitarian theology which they have
since maintained. Here, for a time, was the centre of the liberal politics and
the literary taste of the entire county.... The Academy was founded in
1757, and was closed in 1786. It was visited by John Howard, W. Roscoe, T.
Pennant, Currie, the biographer of Burns, &amp;c. The first Tutors appointed
were <span class='sc'>Dr. John Taylor</span> of Norwich, Tutor in Divinity, <span class='sc'>Mr. Holt</span> of Kirkdale,
Tutor in Natural Philosophy, <span class='sc'>Mr. Dyer</span> of London, Tutor in Languages and
Polite Literature, whose duties, however, were taken by <span class='sc'>Mr.</span> (afterwards the
<span class='sc'>Rev. Dr.</span>) <span class='sc'>Aikin</span>, father of the celebrated Physician and Mrs. Barbauld. <span class='sc'>Dr.
Priestley</span> succeeded <span class='sc'>Dr. Aikin</span>.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dr. Priestley</span>, who is addressed by <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span> as “Patriot, and Saint, and
Sage,” was succeeded by <span class='sc'>John Reinhold Forster</span>, a German Scholar and
Naturalist, who accompanied Captain Cook in his second voyage, <span class='sc'>Dr. Enfield</span>,
author of <cite>The Speaker</cite>, and the <span class='sc'>Rev. Gilbert Wakefield</span>, were Tutors. Among
the students were <span class='sc'>Mr. Serjeant Heywood</span>; <span class='sc'>Archibald Hamilton Rowan</span>,
the Irish rebel; the <span class='sc'>Rev. H. Malthus</span>; <span class='sc'>Lord Ennismore</span>; <span class='sc'>Sir James
Carnegie</span> of Southesk; <span class='sc'>Mr. Henry Beaufoy</span>, etc., all strong Whigs. The
name of neither <span class='sc'>Mara</span> nor <span class='sc'>Le Maitre</span> appears on the Minutes of the Academy.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the latest contribution to the history of <span class='sc'>Marat’s</span> sojourn in England we
are indebted to the researches of <span class='sc'>Mr. H. Morse Stephens</span>, of Balliol College,
Oxford, who, in his elaborate and painstaking <cite>History of the French Revolution</cite>
(1886), which includes facts unknown to Carlyle and earlier historians, gives the
following account of that “arch-destroyer”; but, as he calls him, “a much
maligned individual”:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Jean Paul Marat</span>,” says he, “was born at Boudry, near Neufchatel, in
Switzerland, on April 13, 1742. His father, who spelt his name ‘<span class='sc'>Mara</span>,’ was a
physician of some ability, and on being exiled from his native island of Sardinia
for abandoning the Roman Catholic religion, had taken up his residence in
Switzerland; and married a Swiss Protestant. <span class='sc'>Jean Paul</span> was the eldest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>three sons; his next brother settled down as a watchmaker at Geneva, and his
youngest brother entered the service of the Empress Catherine, and distinguished
himself in the Russian army under the title of the Chevalier de
Boudry. <span class='sc'>Jean Paul</span> was from his childhood of an intensely sensitive and
excitable disposition, and also so quick at his books that he became a good
classical scholar, and acquainted with most modern languages. As his chief
taste, however, seemed to be for natural science, he was intended to follow his
father’s profession, and was, at the age of eighteen, sent to study medicine at
the University of Bordeaux. He there obtained a thorough knowledge of his
profession, but devoted himself particularly to the sciences of optics and electricity.
From Bordeaux he went to Paris, where he effected a remarkable cure
of a disease of the eyes, which had been abandoned as hopeless both by
physicians and quacks, by means of electricity. From Paris he went to Amsterdam,
and, finally, to <span class='sc'>London</span>, where he set up in practice in <em>Church Street, Soho</em>,
then one of the most fashionable districts in London. He must soon have
formed a good practice, for he stopped in London, with occasional visits to
Dublin and Edinburgh, for ten years, and only left it to take up an appointment
at the French court. While in London he wrote his first book, and in
1772 and 1773, he published the first two volumes of a philosophical and physiological
<cite>Essay on Man</cite>. The point he discussed was the old problem of the relation
between body and mind, and he treated it in a very interesting manner
from the physiological point of view. He held some extraordinary theory
about the existence of some fluid in the veins which acted on the mind; which,
however, does not impair the interest of his inquiries into the cause of dreams,
or diminish the respect felt for his wide reading and extensive knowledge both
of ancient and modern philosophical and medical authors. He shows a wide
knowledge of Latin and Greek literature, and while writing in good English
freely quotes French, German, Italian, and Spanish writers. In one part of his
book he declared that it was ridiculous for any one to make psychical researches
without having some knowledge of anatomy and physiology, and openly attacked
<span class='sc'>Helvétius</span> for despising scientific knowledge in his famous <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De l’Esprit</span></cite>.
<span class='sc'>Voltaire</span> naturally took the side of <span class='sc'>Helvétius</span>, and did the young author the
honour of noticing, and very severely criticising, his book. <span class='sc'>Marat</span> himself
translated it into French, and published it at Amsterdam in 1775. His next
work was of a political character. He had got mixed up with some of the
popular societies in England, which were striving to obtain a thorough reform
of the representation of the people in the House of Commons, and, in 1774,
published a work, which he entitled <span class='sc'>The Chains of Slavery</span>. In this book, which
is partly historical and partly political, he begs the electors to take more care in
the choice of their representatives. It is written in a very declamatory style,
and strikes the note of the responsibility of representatives to their constituents,
which is the key-note of all his political ideas. The book is published in quarto,
and is printed on fine paper, so that it can hardly have been meant to appeal to
the populace, but it, nevertheless, procured him the honorary membership of
the popular societies of <em>Newcastle</em> and other great northern cities. Subsequently
he again returned to his profession, and after publishing a medical tract in
1775, of which no copy is known to exist, he published <cite>An Inquiry into the
Nature, Cause, and Cure of a singular Disease of the Eyes</cite>, in 1776. [See <cite>Academy</cite> of
September 23, 1882.] In this little pamphlet there is no violent language;
it describes the disease and the cases he had cured in perfectly simple language,
and shows, at least, that he was no mere quack, but a scientific physician. On
June 30, 1775, he had, while on a visit to <em>Scotland</em>, received the honorary degree
of M.D. from the <em>University of St. Andrews</em> for his eminence as a doctor, and had
probably received similar compliments from other Universities, because, on
June 24, 1777, <span class='sc'>Jean Paul Marat</span>, ‘médecin de plusieurs facultés d’Angleterre,’
was appointed, for his good character and high reputation as a doctor, physician
to the body-guard of the Comte d’Artois, with a salary of a thousand livres a
year and allowances. To take up this court appointment he moved to Paris,
and soon acquired a large practice there, and the name of ‘physician of the
incurables,’ from the number of hopeless cases he was successful in treating.
He also moved in the best society about the court, and won the affections of
the <em>Marquise de l’Aubespine</em> for saving her life. For some reason or other, most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>probably because he had obtained a competent fortune, and desired to satisfy
his ambition, he resigned his court appointment in 1783, and devoted himself to
science. He had long observed the phenomena of Heat, Light, and Electricity,
and in the course of the next five years published the result of his experiments,
and presented them to the <em>Academy of Sciences</em>. His hard work won him the
friendship of <span class='sc'>Benjamin Franklin</span>, but the violence with which he attacked his
adversaries, and his audacity in doubting the conclusions of <span class='sc'>Newton</span>, prevented
him from obtaining a seat in the Academy of Sciences. When he recognised
that this hostility to himself prevented due recognition of his work, he determined
to win the approbation of the Academy by concealing his name; and his
translation of the <cite>Optics</cite> of <span class='sc'>Newton</span>, which was covered by the name of <em>M. de
Beauzée</em>, and published in 1788, was at once crowned by the very Academy which
had rejected him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His political work during these years was confined to a treatise, in imitation
of <span class='sc'>Beccaria</span>, on the subject of Punishments. The approach of the States-General,
however, revived his political enthusiasm, and in the March of 1789,
when he believed himself to be dying, he published his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Offrande à la Patrie</span></i>,
which was followed in quick succession by a supplement and other pamphlets.
Of these, distinctly the most able is the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tableau des Vices de la Constitution
Anglaise</span></cite>, which he presented to the Assembly in September, 1789. In it he
points out what he had learnt in the popular societies of England, that the
English people was by no means so well governed as it was supposed to be;
that the influence of the king and the ministry was overwhelming through the
extent of patronage, and that the rich there bought seats in the House of Commons
as they bought estates.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Marat</span> then felt that he could not express himself frequently enough in
pamphlets, and on September 12 appeared the first number of a journal written
entirely by himself, called the <span class='sc'>Journal du Peuple</span>, which title was changed to
that of <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ami du Peuple</span></cite>, or <cite>The People’s Friend</cite>, with the fourth number.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To understand the man, it is necessary to get rid of preconceived ideas.
Suspicious and irritable, excitable and sensitive to an extreme, he attacked
everybody, and attacked them all with unaccustomed violence; but with all
this, he was in private life a highly educated gentleman. The extent of his
attainments appears from his numerous works, and it must be remembered that
he could not for years have been a fashionable physician and held a court
appointment without being perfectly polite and well-bred. His faults arose
from his irritable and suspicious nature, and years of persecution made him
half-insane towards the end of his life; but in September, 1789, he was in perfect
possession of his senses, and the very popularity of his journal showed how congenial
his gospel of suspicion was to the Parisians.”—[<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<h3 class='c031'><span class='sc'>Jean Paul Marat’s Sister.</span></h3>

<p class='c043'>The Right Hon. J. W. Croker, in a letter to John Winter Jones, dated 23rd
October, 1854, says that <span class='sc'>Colin</span>, who had been Marat’s printer or publisher,
“introduced him to Marat’s sister, who was as like her brother, he said—and
as from all pictures and busts I readily believed—as ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deux gouttes
d’eau</span></i>’. She was very small, very ugly, very sharp, and a great politician.
Her ostensible livelihood was making watch-springs, but she told me she was
pretty easy in her circumstances, and I either gathered from her, or saw cause
to suspect, that she had some secret charitable help.”—[<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c043'><span class='sc'>Laréveillère-Lepaux</span> left orders in his will that his <cite>Memoirs</cite> were to be
printed and published. His heirs were not proud of the part the <span class='sc'>Director</span>
had played, so, after complying with the terms of his will and <em>printing</em> the
<cite>Memoirs</cite>, they <em>destroyed the whole issue at once</em>; and the only copy extant is the
one which, in accordance with the law of France, was sent to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèque

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>
  <h3 class='c031'>THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c043'>These (<em>Gr.</em> “Lovers of Gods and Men”) were a sect of <em>Deists</em> which appeared
in France amid the confusion and disorder of the first Revolution. While the
State was indifferent to all forms of Religion, and the Republican Directory was
afraid of the Christianity which prevailed in the Church, a felt consciousness
of the necessity of some religion led many to adopt a form of worship adapted
to Natural Religion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This Sect” (says <span class='sc'>Southey</span>, in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, vol. xxviii.) “began with
more circumstances in their favour than ever occurred to facilitate the establishment
of a religion or of a sect. Many persons of considerable influence and
reputation engaged in the project with zeal, and it was patronised by <span class='sc'>La
Réveillère Lêpaux</span>, one of the Directory.... His motives for putting himself
at the head of the Theophilanthropists are said to have been twofold: if
the scheme succeeded, he intended to become their High Priest; and he hated
Christianity. Through his means the Theophilanthropists obtained a decree
from the Government giving them a right of holding their meetings in the
Churches, as national buildings, which were open to any religion, but belonged
to none.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nearly twenty Churches in Paris were taken possession of; but by occupying
so many, they injured themselves.... They took up too extended a position,
and had neither numbers nor means answerable to the scale upon which they
set out.... Their <em>Service</em> began at noon, and lasted about an hour and a half.
It was, they said, a worship for those who had no other, and a moral society
for those who had. The <em>Ritual</em> consisted of Prayers, Hymns original or selected
from the best French Poets, readings from their Manual, and Discourses. The
<em>Hymns</em> were, in general, judicious, and set to good music, and the <em>Prayers</em> well
composed; but had their books been stript of all that they had borrowed from
the Gospel, and from the works of Christian writers, they would have been
meagre indeed. In one part of the Service there was a short pause, during
which the congregation were expected to consider each in silence what his own
conduct had been since the last of these meetings. A basket of fruit or
flowers, according to the season, was placed upon the altar, as a mark of acknowledgment
for the bounties of the Creator; and over the altar was the
inscription, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous croyons à l’existence de Dieu, et à l’immortalité de l’âme</span></i>.... <span class='sc'>La
Réveillère</span>, in a speech at the Institute, declaiming against Christianity, as
being opposed to the liberty of mankind, expressed his wish that a form of
religion were adopted, which should have only <em>a couple of articles</em>. He wished
also for a religion without priests; and this, it was pleasantly observed, would
be like a Directory without a Director.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This was the <cite>Creed of the Theophilanthropists</cite>. And on each side of it, the
following sentences were inscribed in their temples, to take place of the
Decalogue:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Adore God, cherish your fellow-creatures; render yourselves useful to your</div>
      <div class='line in4'>country.</div>
      <div class='line'>Good is whatever tends to preserve man, or to perfectionate him.</div>
      <div class='line'>Evil is whatever tends to destroy him, or to deteriorate him.</div>
      <div class='line'>Children, honour your fathers and mothers; obey them with affection, solace</div>
      <div class='line in4'>their old age. Fathers and mothers, instruct your children.</div>
      <div class='line'>Wives, behold in your husbands the heads of your houses. Husbands, love</div>
      <div class='line in4'>your wives, and render yourselves mutually happy.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“At <em>Marriage</em> the bride and bridegroom were to be coupled with ribands, or
garlands of flowers, the ends of which were to be held on each side by the
elders of their respective families. The Bride received a ring from her husband,
and a medal of union from the head of the family. There was a rite also for
infants.... When a member <em>died</em>, the other members of the Society were
invited to place a flower upon the urn, and pray the Creator to receive the
deceased into his bosom. The Decades and National Holidays were observed
by these Anti-Christians, and they had four Holidays of their own, for Socrates,
St. Vincent de Paule, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Washington,—oddly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>assorted names! Two of them, however, stand well together in this kalendar,
for the one, who was a Christian, established the Foundling Hospital at Paris;
and the other, who was a sentimentalist, a philosopher, and a Theophilanthropist,
sent his own children to it....</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>La Réveillère</span> used to take praise to himself for having, in his Directorial
character, humbled the Pope and the great Turk. The Anti-Christian
language of the Directory, and its persecution of the Clergy, are imputed to
him; so far his colleagues were willing to go with him; but his zeal for
Deism they regarded as ridiculous.... In the way of pecuniary aid, he
could obtain little:—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beaucoup d’argent</span></i> was what the Directory were accustomed
to demand, not to give....</p>

<p class='c007'>“Their <em>Service</em> at Paris was numerously attended while it was a new
spectacle, and the subject of conversation; but more than two-thirds of the
persons thus assembled were idlers. But this concourse soon abated; there
was nothing attractive in the ceremonies, nothing to impose upon the
imagination or the senses. A propagandist reported from Montreuil that
the readings and orations had been heard by an audience <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avide de morale</span></i>,
but he had observed with pain that the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</span></i> of the worship was not
what it should have been.... It was got up at Bourges in better style;
the orator there officiated in a white sash ornamented with blue flowers,
before an altar upon which an orange tree was placed: and at the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête des
époux</span></i>, the Theophilanthropists carried <em>two pigeons</em> in procession, as an
emblem of conjugal tenderness, and placed them upon the altar of the country!”</p>

<p class='c007'>[The literary association of <span class='sc'>Lamb</span> with <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span> and <span class='sc'>Southey</span> [says
<span class='sc'>Sir T. N. Talfourd</span>, in his life of <span class='sc'>Lamb</span>,] drew upon him the hostility of the
young scorners of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>, who, luxuriating in boyish pride and aristocratic
patronage, tossed the arrows of their wit against all charged with innovation,
whether in politics or poetry, and cared little whom they wounded.
No one could be more innocent than <span class='sc'>Lamb</span> of political heresy; no one more
strongly opposed to new theories in morality—which he always regarded with
disgust. The very first number of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine</cite> [this
was, however, a new work, by different hands, but imbued with the same spirit
as <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>] was adorned by a caricature of <span class='sc'>Gillray’s</span>, in which <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span>
and <span class='sc'>Southey</span> were introduced with asses’ heads, and <span class='sc'>Lloyd</span> and <span class='sc'>Lamb</span>
as toad and frog. In the number of July, 1798 [of the original <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite>]
appeared the well-known poem of <cite>New Morality</cite>, in which all the prominent
objects of the hatred of these champions of religion and order were introduced
as offering homage to <span class='sc'>Lepaux</span>, a French charlatan,—of whose existence <span class='sc'>Lamb</span>
had never even heard. Not content with thus confounding persons of the most
opposite opinions and the most various characters in one common libel, the
party returned to the charge in their number for September [of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin
Review</cite>], and denounced the young poets in a parody on the <cite>Ode to the Passions</cite>,
under the title of <cite>The Anarchists</cite>. They are reprinted in the present volume.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c007'>[The cause of Coleridge, Southey, Lloyd, and Lamb, being thus satirized as
persons of the same politics, was the conjoint publication of their works. In
the spring of 1796, <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span> published vol. i. of his <cite>Juvenile Poems</cite>, including
three Sonnets by <span class='sc'>Lamb</span>; in May, 1797, there appeared a new edition, with many
poems by <span class='sc'>Lloyd</span> and <span class='sc'>Lamb</span>. <cite>The Fall of Robespierre</cite>, an historic drama, was
published Sept. 22, 1794: the first act written by <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span>, the second and
third by <span class='sc'>Southey</span>. It is not difficult to understand why <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span> was so
severely attacked by the Government writers. In 1795, at the early age of 23,
he delivered, at Bristol, some public lectures, reflecting in warm terms on the
measures of <span class='sc'>Pitt</span>. Three of them were published at Bristol at the end of 1795—the
first two together, with the title of <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conciones ad Populum</span></cite>; the third as
<cite>The Plot Discovered</cite>. The eloquent passage in conclusion of the first of these
addresses was written by <span class='sc'>Southey</span>. That he was considered by ministers a
dangerous character is proved by his having been for some months watched by
a Government spy while residing at Stowey, providing for his scanty maintenance
by writing verses for <cite>The Morning Post</cite>. It was his fortune also to excite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>the ire of <span class='sc'>Buonaparte</span>, by his anti-gallican writings in the same paper; and a
benevolent intimation of his danger by Baron von Humboldt and Cardinal
Fesch alone prevented his being arrested while in Italy. (See p. <a href='#Page_284'>284</a>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Southey</span> thus alludes to the attack upon him (by <span class='sc'>Gillray</span>, in his famous
caricature), in a letter addressed to <span class='sc'>C. W. W. Wynn</span>, dated Hereford, August
15, 1798:—“I have seen myself <em>Bedfordized</em>, and it has been a subject of much
amusement. <span class='sc'>Holcroft’s</span> likeness is admirably preserved. I know not what
poor <span class='sc'>Lamb</span> has done to be croaking there. What I think the worst part of <cite>The
Anti-Jacobin</cite> abuse is the lumping together men of such opposite principles;
this was stupid. We should have all been welcoming the <cite>Director</cite>, not the <cite>Theophilanthrope</cite>.
The conductors of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite> will have much to answer for
in thus inflaming the animosities of this country. They are labouring to produce
the deadly hatred of Irish faction; perhaps to produce the same end.
Such an address as you mention might probably be of great use; that I could
assist you in it is less certain. I do not feel myself at all calculated for anything
that requires methodical reasoning; and though you and I should agree in the
main object of the pamphlet, our opinions are at root different. The old systems
of government, I think, must fall; but in this country the immediate danger is
on the other hand,—from an unconstitutional and unlimited power. <span class='sc'>Burleigh</span>
saw how a Parliament might be employed against the people, and <span class='sc'>Montesquieu</span>
prophesied the fall of English liberty when the Legislature should become corrupt.
You will not agree with me in thinking his prophecy fulfilled. Violent

and all the eminent men of that time with whom he lived when he was
young. He said&nbsp;... that <span class='sc'>Fitzpatrick</span> was the most agreeable of them
all, but <span class='sc'>Hare</span> the most brilliant. <span class='sc'>Burke’s</span> conversation was delightful, so
luminous and instructive. He was very passionate; and <span class='sc'>Adair</span> said that the
first time he ever saw him he unluckily asked him some question about the wild
parts of Ireland, when <span class='sc'>Burke</span> broke out: ‘You are a fool and a blockhead.
There are no wild parts in Ireland.’&nbsp;... There was an attempt to bring
about a reconciliation between him and <span class='sc'>Fox</span>, and a meeting for that purpose
took place of all the leading men, at Burlington House. <span class='sc'>Burke</span> was on the
point of yielding when his son suddenly made his appearance unbidden, and,
on being told what was going on, he said: ‘My father shall be no party to such

<h3 class='c031'>THE COURIER.</h3>

<p class='c043'><span class='sc'>The Courier</span>, in the time of the war, was the great paper; it obtained a large
circulation, and consequently exercised considerable influence. It was started
by <span class='sc'>John Parry</span> in 1792, and he carried it on for some years with tolerable
success, till he was ruined in 1799 by a government prosecution for a libel on the
Emperor of Russia. It was bought by <span class='sc'>Daniel Stuart</span>, who left <cite>The Morning
Post</cite> for <cite>The Courier</cite> in 1803. During three years, says he, at the time of the
overthrow of <span class='sc'>Buonaparte</span>, <cite>The Courier</cite>, by the able management of <span class='sc'>Peter
Street</span>, who was editor and half-proprietor, sold steadily upwards of 8000 per
day; during one fortnight it sold upwards of 10,000 daily. At the end of 1809,
<span class='sc'>S. T. Coleridge</span> contributed to it some Essays on the Spaniards; and in 1811
he wrote for it on a salary. At this time the paper was much under ministerial
direction. From about the year 1818 till 1829 <cite>The Courier</cite> was conducted by <span class='sc'>W.
Mudford</span>, with whom <span class='sc'>William Stewart</span> was a proprietor. After 1819 <span class='sc'>D.
Stuart</span> took no interest in it, and parted with his last share in it in 1822.
After the year 1825, <span class='sc'>James Stuart</span>, a Scotch gentleman of great talent and
respectability—the same that unfortunately killed <span class='sc'>Sir Alexander Boswell</span>
in a duel, and was author of <cite>Travels in the United States</cite>—became editor. True
to his principles, he gave in this capacity every support in his power to the
Whig or Liberal party. He was appointed by <span class='sc'>Lord Melbourne</span> to the situation
of Factory Inspector, which he held till his death, at the age of 74, in 1849.
When <span class='sc'>Jas. Stuart</span> obtained his factory appointment, <span class='sc'>Sam. Laman Blanchard</span>
became editor. The paper having become, like other evening papers, less profitable
than of old, the proprietors sold it to the party they had so long opposed.
It took Tory politics; <span class='sc'>Laman Blanchard</span>, of course, resigned; and a few short
years were sufficient to destroy a journal which had once been the most valuable
newspaper property in England. Its last number appeared 6th July, 1842.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a curious, but not creditable, circumstance that <cite>The Courier</cite> was in the
habit of re-printing, from year to year, without acknowledgment, the able leading
articles from <cite>The Liverpool Courier</cite>, written by the Rev. Richard Watson,
secretary to the Wesleyan Missionary Society, by whom, in conjunction with
his friend, Mr. Kaye, this newspaper was established upon loyal and constitutional
principles.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<cite>The Courier</cite>, in 1814, was supplied by R. Peel, Lord Palmerston, and J. W.
Croker, with political squibs and lyrics, resembling in general features <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>
and <cite>The Rolliad</cite>. The verses are chiefly parodies of Moore’s <cite>Irish
Melodies</cite>, or of Byron’s songs, and are far above the ordinary level of such compositions....
The various pieces were collected and published in 1815, under
the title of <cite>The New Whig Guide</cite>.”—<cite>Croker Papers</cite>, vol. i., p. 58.</p>

<p class='c007'>This statement contains several inaccuracies. The pieces forming <cite>The New
Whig Guide</cite> were first collected and published in 1819, <em>and not in 1815</em>, for
<span class='sc'>Byron’s</span> <cite>Fare thee well</cite> was not written till April, 1816. The parody on it was
entitled <cite>The Leader’s Lament. By the Right Hon. George Ponsonby</cite>. A. Hayward
says in his review of <cite>The Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</cite>, in <cite>The Edinburgh Review</cite>,
1858—that “<span class='sc'>Canning</span> has been traditionally credited with the parody of Moore’s.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span><em>Believe me, if all those endearing young charms</em>, the gentleman addressed being a
distinguished commoner afterwards ennobled (the first <span class='sc'>Lord Methuen</span>), who
was far from meriting the character [of a foolish fop] thereby fastened on him”.
The other parodies were by <span class='sc'>John Calcraft</span>, the Hon. <span class='sc'>W. H. Lyttelton</span>,
<span class='sc'>Dudley North</span>, M.P., <span class='sc'>Kirkman Finlay</span>, M.P. for Glasgow, &amp;c. <span class='sc'>Mr.
Methuen</span>, in return, wrote many clever squibs and parodies against the
Tories, which were collected, under the title of <cite>The New Tory Guide</cite>, and reproduced,
like its rivals in 1819. “Talking of <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite>,” says <span class='sc'>T.
Moore</span> (<cite>Diary, 19th March, 1831</cite>), “<span class='sc'>Paul Methuen</span> told us he was the author
of almost all those about <cite>The Rat Club</cite>; which are certainly some of the best.”</p>

<h3 class='c031'>THE STAR.</h3>

<p class='c043'><span class='sc'>The Star</span>, the first London daily Evening Newspaper, was started in 1788 by
<span class='sc'>Peter Stuart</span>, brother to <span class='sc'>Daniel Stuart</span>, of <cite>The Morning Post</cite>. Its first
editor was <span class='sc'>Andrew Macdonald</span>, author of <cite>Vimonda</cite>, a tragedy, and other
works: and after him another Scottish poet, John Mayne, author of <cite>The Siller
Gun</cite>, was editor. <span class='sc'>Robert Burns</span> was offered an engagement to write poetry
for it, at the rate of one guinea an article per week. The arrangement was not
completed. It was to <span class='sc'>Peter Stuart</span> that <span class='sc'>Burns</span> addressed his “Poem,
written to a gentleman who had sent him a Newspaper, and offered to continue it
free of expense”. The facetious Bob Allen, of whom Charles Lamb has such
pleasant reminiscences, was for many years a contributor to this paper. Subsequently,
<span class='sc'>Dr. A. Tilloch</span>, editor of <cite>The Philosophical Magazine</cite>, was for many
years editor of <cite>The Star</cite>. After Oct. 15, 1831, <cite>The Star</cite> became incorporated
with <cite>The Albion</cite> newspaper, under the title of <cite>The Albion and Evening Star</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Star</cite> was during many years the leading newspaper on the Whig side,
<span class='sc'>Campbell</span> the poet being one of its writers after 1804, when he was engaged at
a salary of four guineas a week. The clear profits of this paper in 1820 were
said, on apparently good authority, to amount to £6000.</p>

<h3 class='c031'>THE MORNING CHRONICLE.</h3>

<p class='c043'><span class='sc'>The Morning Chronicle</span> was, with one exception (<cite>The Public Ledger</cite>, which
started in 1760), the oldest of the daily papers up to the period of its discontinuance
March 19, 1862. The latest number in the British Museum is dated
Dec. 31, 1861.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was established on Whig principles, 28th June, 1769, by <span class='sc'>William Woodfall</span>,
who carried it on with great success till 1789.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woodfall, in addition to other talents requisite to the success of a newspaper,
possessed two, which were of essential service to it, namely, his prodigious
memory, which enabled him to report Parliamentary Debates without the aid
of notes, and the excellence of his Theatrical Criticisms, which, as <span class='sc'>Mr. Fox
Bourne</span>, in his copious and valuable work on <em>English Newspapers</em>, 2 vols., 8vo., 1887—one
to which the editor of the present publication has been under frequent
obligations—says, “are a neglected mine of wealth for students of Theatrical
History”.</p>

<p class='c007'>On <span class='sc'>Woodfall’s</span> death, in 1803, it was sold to <span class='sc'>James Perry</span>, who borrowed
£500 from <span class='sc'>Ransome &amp; Co.</span>, the bankers, and some more from <span class='sc'>Bellamy</span>, the
wine merchant—who was also caterer and doorkeeper to the House of Commons—and
entered into partnership with a Charterhouse schoolmaster named
<span class='sc'>Gray</span>, who had just received a legacy of £500. With that joint capital, the two
bought <cite>The Chronicle</cite>, the <span class='sc'>Duke of Norfolk</span> making <span class='sc'>Perry</span> a present of a
house in the Strand, which he converted into a new publishing office. A few
other influential Whigs, also, contributed a further sum, which, as the late <span class='sc'>Sir
Robert Adair</span>, who is so often satirized in <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite>, and who was a
subscriber to the fund, informed the editor of the present work, was £300.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Perry</span> was on good terms with his contributors, and made <cite>The Morning
Chronicle</cite> a more prosperous and influential journal than had ever before been
known in England. <span class='sc'>Gray</span> provided the heavy articles, <span class='sc'>Perry</span> those of lighter
sort; and after <span class='sc'>Gray’s</span> death, which happened when he had been part proprietor
for only a few years, other writers were employed, among them <span class='sc'>Jas. Mackintosh</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>and <span class='sc'>Sheridan</span>, and in later times <span class='sc'>T. Campbell</span> and <span class='sc'>T. Moore</span>, who contributed
verse, and <span class='sc'>John Campbell</span>, then a young barrister, who was the
Theatrical Critic, and was still so in 1810. <span class='sc'>T. Campbell</span>, on coming to London
in 1802, was engaged as a political writer, but this not being his forte, he, with
great judgment, confined himself to poetical pieces, among which were <cite>Ye
Mariners of England</cite>, and <cite>The Exile of Erin</cite>. <span class='sc'>Perry</span> had another and equally
famous contributor. In Sept., 1793, <span class='sc'>S. T. Coleridge</span>, then aged nineteen, “sent
a poem of a few lines to <span class='sc'>Perry</span>, soliciting a loan of a guinea for a distressed
author,” which prayer was immediately granted. In 1796, he accepted an offer
of Perry’s to write in it, but the arrangement was never carried out. In later
years, <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span> wrote some other poems for <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite>, and his
friend <span class='sc'>Charles Lamb</span> was an occasional writer of prose for it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Perry</span> continued as the general manager of the paper till his death on 6th
Dec., 1821; but before this he had left much of the editing to others, his first assistant
after <span class='sc'>Gray’s</span> death being <span class='sc'>Robert Spankie</span>, ultimately attorney-general
of Bengal. The next was <span class='sc'>John Black</span>, who had joined him in 1810; and upon
him, when <span class='sc'>Perry</span> died, the entire management devolved.</p>

<p class='c007'>After <span class='sc'>Perry’s</span> death the paper was purchased for £42,000, by <span class='sc'>William
Clement</span>, by whom it was held till 1834, when it was sold to <span class='sc'>Sir John Easthope</span>
for £16,500.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1843, <span class='sc'>John Black</span> was dismissed to make way for <span class='sc'>Andrew Doyle</span>, who
had been Foreign Editor, and had married Sir John’s daughter. Black died in
1855.</p>

<p class='c007'>On 26th July, 1847, <span class='sc'>Sir John Easthope</span>, who had been carrying on the paper
at a loss for some time, sold it to the Duke of Newcastle, W. E. Gladstone,
Sidney Herbert, and other influential Peelites. Its new Editor was <span class='sc'>John
Douglas Cook</span>, who had for some time been one of the reporters of <cite>The Times</cite>,
and who gathered round him a brilliant staff of contributors, including George
Sydney Smythe, afterwards Lord Strangford, Gilbert Venables, Abraham Hayward,
William Vernon Harcourt, and Thackeray. Its business manager was
<span class='sc'>William Delane</span>, the father of the clever young editor of <cite>The Times</cite>, <span class='sc'>John
Thaddeus Delane</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Chronicle</cite> lingered on as a would-be Peelite organ till the autumn of 1854,
when by a curious arrangement, the paper, with all its plant, was sold to Serjeant
<span class='sc'>Glover</span>, for £7500, on the understanding that, if he continued to support in it
the Peelite policy, he should have the money back with interest, being paid
£3000 a year for three years. That contract soon fell through, as <span class='sc'>Glover</span>
preferred to draw a subsidy from <span class='sc'>Louis Napoleon</span>, and to make other experiments.
At the close of 1854, the circulation of <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite> averaged
only about 2500, while that of <cite>The Morning Post</cite> was about 3000, that of <cite>The
Morning Herald</cite> about 3500, that of <cite>The Daily News</cite> about 5300, that of <cite>The
Morning Advertiser</cite> about 6600, and that of <cite>The Times</cite> about 55,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last number of <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite> appeared March 19, 1862, when
what at one time had been the most influential journal in the country altogether
ceased to exist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of this paper <span class='sc'>Sheridan</span> speaks in <cite>The Critic</cite>, and to it <span class='sc'>Byron</span> addressed a
<cite>Familiar Epistle</cite>. For its columns <span class='sc'>W. Hazlitt</span> wrote some of the finest criticisms
in our own or any other language. Some of the early <cite>Sketches by Boz</cite>
appeared in it, but they were really commenced in the old <cite>Monthly Magazine</cite>.
<span class='sc'>Dickens’s</span> father was one of the staff. <span class='sc'>Hazlitt</span> also contributed to it Parliamentary
Reports, as at a later period did <span class='sc'>C. Dickens</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among other distinguished writers in <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite> were Lord
Brougham, the Duke of Sussex, David Ricardo, Cyrus Redding, Albany Fonblanque,
James and John Stuart Mill, John Payne Collier, Eyre Evans Crowe,
Charles Buller, Lord Holland, Joseph Parkes, Michael Joseph Quin, George
Hogarth, James Fraser, W. Hazlitt, secundus, Lord Melbourne, W. Johnson
Fox, Henry Mayhew, Lord Palmerston, A. B. Reach, Alex. and Charles Mackay,
Tom Taylor.</p>

<h3 class='c031'>THE MORNING POST.</h3>

<p class='c043'><span class='sc'>The Morning Post</span>, the next <em>daily</em> paper in order of date to <cite>The Chronicle</cite>,
first appeared in 1772, and was probably projected by <span class='sc'>John Bell</span>. Three years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>subsequently the <span class='sc'>Rev. Henry Bate</span> (who took in 1784 the name of Dudley, and
was created a baronet in 1816) joined it, and was connected with it till the end
of 1780, when he quarrelled with his colleagues, and set up <cite>The Morning Herald</cite>,
the first number of which appeared on Nov. 1 in the same year. In June, 1781,
he was sentenced to a year’s imprisonment for an atrocious libel on the Duke of
Richmond. He was (says Horace Walpole, in his <cite>Journal of the Reign of George
III.</cite>), the worst of all the scandalous libellers that had appeared, both on private
persons as well as public. His life was dissolute, and he had fought more than
one duel. Yet Lord Sandwich had procured for him a good Crown living, and
he was believed to be pensioned by the Court. He died in 1824.</p>

<p class='c007'>After <span class='sc'>Bate</span>, as editor, came the <span class='sc'>Rev. W. Jackman</span> (or <span class='sc'>Jackson</span>)—an equally
discreditable clergyman,—and he was succeeded by <span class='sc'>John Taylor</span> (author of
<em>Monsieur Tonson</em>), for whom <span class='sc'>Peter Pindar</span> (<span class='sc'>Dr. John Wolcot</span>) wrote whimsical
verses.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1792, <span class='sc'>Mr. Tattersall</span> was the responsible proprietor, who, knowing more
about horses and sport than about the elegancies of literature, <span class='sc'>Dr. Wolcot</span>
continued to be the chief writer; and who, besides his clever verses, gave much
information upon affairs of the prize-ring and kindred amusements. In 1795,
<span class='sc'>Tattersall</span> sold the entire copyright, with house and printing materials, for
£600. The circulation then was only 350 daily.</p>

<p class='c007'>The purchaser was <span class='sc'>Mr. Daniel Stuart</span>; and <span class='sc'>Mr. Christie</span>, the auctioneer,
was also a proprietor. Previous to this time, <span class='sc'>Robert Burns</span> was applied to, to
supply poetry, but none was ever sent. <span class='sc'>Daniel Stuart</span> was not twenty-nine
when he bought <cite>The Morning Post</cite>; and <span class='sc'>James</span> (afterwards <span class='sc'>Sir Jas.</span>) <span class='sc'>Mackintosh</span>,
who was his brother-in-law, and was a regular contributor, was his senior
only by a year.</p>

<p class='c007'>After 1790, the same <span class='sc'>Andrew Macdonald</span>, who had been editor of <cite>The Star</cite>,
furnished poems, as did <span class='sc'>Wordsworth</span>, <span class='sc'>Southey</span>, <span class='sc'>C. Lloyd</span>, and other verse
writers. At the commencement of 1798, <span class='sc'>S. T. Coleridge</span>—then only twenty-five—was
engaged to contribute poetry. The Odes, <cite>Fire, Famine, and Slaughter</cite>;
<cite>France</cite>; <cite>Dejection</cite>; and that on <cite>The Departing Year</cite>; with twenty or thirty other
pieces, since included in his Poetical Works, among which was <cite>Love</cite>—one of the
most popular poems of this age—were first published in <cite>The Morning Post</cite>. To
these must be added the first draught of <cite>The Devil’s Thoughts</cite>, a piece afterwards
much altered. About 1800, the paper was supplied with some excellent pieces,
in prose, including Fashionable Intelligence, short pungent articles, and jokes,
by <span class='sc'>Charles Lamb</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1798 its sale was over 2000; and so well had <span class='sc'>Daniel Stuart</span> managed his
property—being exceedingly well served by his principal assistant, <span class='sc'>George
Lane</span>—that when he left <cite>The Morning Post</cite> for <cite>The Courier</cite>, in 1803, the circulation
amounted to 4,500. It, therefore, stood higher in point of sale than any
other morning paper, the order in respect of numbers from high to low being
this: <cite>Morning Post</cite>, <cite>Morning Herald</cite>, <cite>Morning Advertiser</cite>, <cite>Times</cite>. The amount
received for it was about £25,000. According to <span class='sc'>John Taylor</span>, editor of <cite>The
Sun</cite>, in his <cite>Records of my Life</cite>, <cite>The Morning Post</cite> was afterwards purchased by
Government to silence attacks on the <span class='sc'>Prince Regent</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much of the success of <cite>The Morning Post</cite> was undoubtedly owing to the
writings of <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span>. He afterwards declared that he had wasted the prime
and manhood of his intellect in writing for <cite>The Morning Post</cite> and <cite>Courier</cite>.
Among his contributions to the former (March 19, 1800) was his famous
character of <span class='sc'>William Pitt</span>. The last time he wrote in it was in August, 1802.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very competent judge, <span class='sc'>Thomas De Quincey</span>, thus alludes to <span class='sc'>Coleridge’s</span>
political writings:—“Worlds of fine thinking,” he says of the daily press, “lie
buried in that vast abyss, never to be disentombed, or restored to human
admiration. Like the sea, it has swallowed treasures without end, that no
diving-bell will bring up again. But nowhere throughout its shoreless magazines
of wealth does there lie such a bed of pearls, confounded with the rubbish
and ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">purgamenta</span></i>’ of ages, as in the political papers of <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span>. No more
appreciable monument could be raised to the memory of <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span>, than a
re-publication of his Essays in <cite>The Morning Post</cite>, but still more of those afterwards
published in <cite>The Courier</cite>.” These have since been reprinted under the
title of <cite>Essays on his own Times</cite>.</p>

    <div><em>By Peter Porcupine. 8vo., pp. 96. Price 2s. Wright, London.</em></div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c047'>The past writings of Mr. William Cobbett, who has assumed the appellation
of Peter Porcupine, are too well known in England to require any
explanation from us, either of <em>their</em> tendency, or of the author’s principles.
Were any doubt entertained on the subject, nothing more would be requisite to
dispel it than a mere reference to the comments of all the Jacobin Reviewers;
who have, without exception, in defiance alike of decency and of truth, lavished
on them the most indiscriminate censure and the most scurrilous abuse.
Strange as it may appear, it is indisputably true that the individual exertions
of Mr. Cobbett have more essentially contributed to give a proper tone to the
public spirit in America than all the efforts of the well-disposed part of the
native Americans: for a considerable length of time he combated alone a host
of foes, “himself a host”; stemmed the impetuous tide of democracy; and
checked the irruptions of French anarchy and atheism, which threatened to
overwhelm the American States, and, with the ruins of their confliction, to
crush everything for which the Americans, at the period of their revolution,
professed to fight, and which they have ever since professed to cherish. The
adoption of such a line of conduct was alone sufficient to draw down upon our
author the vengeance of all whose treasonable designs his manly efforts were
intended to defeat. Accordingly, nothing was spared by the infuriated advocates
of anarchy to injure him in the public mind, and, by blasting his reputation,
to deprive him of that credit which was indispensably necessary to secure
the success of his works. No imputation however base, no lie however
atrocious, none of those black and diabolical arts, in short, which, issuing from
the bubbling cauldron of democracy, were so skilfully employed to blacken the
first and fairest character in France, as a necessary prelude to the establishment
of the <em>virtuous</em> republic of the Great Nation, were neglected in the
<em>glorious</em> attempt to achieve the ruin of this worthy individual. When these
were found to fail of producing the desired effect, recourse was had to personal
threats—the coward’s weapon—with the hope of inducing him, by the means of
intimidation, to quit a country in which his enemies endeavoured to convince
him that his life was daily exposed to most imminent danger. But neither
the dread of calumny, nor the fear of assassination, could lead the object of
their persecution to forego his laudable design. He manfully persevered, and
has at length, though not without infinite difficulty, succeeded in opening the
eyes of the Americans to their own interest, and in the infamous machinations
of France, and of American traitors in the pay of France—for England is not the
<span class='fss'>ONLY</span> country in which foreign gold is employed as a stimulus to domestic
treason.<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c024'><sup>[330]</sup></a> In the course of his exertions to produce this desirable end, honest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Peter had occasion to comment on the pusillanimous conduct of the Spanish
monarch, in bending the knee to, and forming an alliance with, the base
plunderers and assassins of his family, and on the insidious and criminal efforts
of the Spanish ambassador to strengthen the hands of the French faction in
America. These comments, it seems, excited the indignation of Don Carlos
Martinez de Trojo, who determined to bring the author to condign punishment;
and it was the very unwarrantable conduct which the latter experienced on the
occasion that gave rise to the publication before us.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Peter</span> begins his tract by stating the dangers to which he knew himself
exposed, on account of his political principles, when he established his
residence in the state of Pennsylvania, “where the government, generally
speaking, was in the hands of those who had (and sometimes with great
indecency) manifested an uniform partiality for the sans-culotte French, and as
uniform an opposition to the ministers and measures of the federal government”.
That men should ever be placed in situations of trust and importance, whose
principles are avowedly adverse to the constitution whence they derive their
subsistence, and which it is their bounden duty to protect, is a circumstance
that would excite universal astonishment if it did not, unhappily, so often
occur. Still the frequency of its occurrence does not alter its nature, nor
should it be allowed to diminish that ample portion of censure which must ever
attach to the authors of such appointments. It is such conduct as this that
justifies one of the wisest observations that ever fell from the pen of Voltaire—“<span class='fss'>A
GOVERNMENT CAN ONLY PERISH BY SUICIDE</span>”—an observation confirmed
by the fate of every country that has been recently reduced beneath the iron
yoke of republican France.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aware of his danger, our author thought the best means of averting it was,
by seeking for some standard, as a safe rule for his conduct in respect to the
liberty of this press. “The English press was said to be <em>enslaved</em>; but, when I
came to consult the practice of this enslaved press, I found it still to be far too
free for me to attempt to follow its example. Finally, it appeared to me to be
the safest way, to form to myself some rule founded on the liberty exercised by
the <em>American press</em>. I concluded that I might without danger go as great
lengths in attacking the enemies of the country as others went in attacking its
friends: that as much zeal might be shown in defending the general government
and administration as in accusing and traducing them: and that as great
warmth would be admissible in the cause of virtue, order, and religion, as had
been tolerated in the wicked cause of villainy, insurrection, and blasphemy”
(p. <a href='#Page_21'>21</a>). Alas! Peter, at this time, knew but little of the “spirit and temper,”
as <span class='sc'>Mr. Barrister Erskine</span> would express it, of democracy and Jacobinism.
He knew not that the men who profess those principles are for the most part
vindictive, malignant, oppressive, and intolerant; and that under the mask of
liberty they exercise the most insupportable tyranny over their families and
dependents, and that in their general conduct to their inferiors—unless when
impelled by interest or urged by ambition, they irritate their passions with
toasts and flattery, from a tavern-chair, or influence their minds by seditious
discourses and treasonable insinuations, from a tribune or a scaffold—they are
supercilious, arrogant, insolent, and overbearing. He knew not, it would seem,
that those whose whole duty is to defend the laws often <em>sleep on their posts</em>, while
their enemies are ever vigilant, active, and alert; that when the former are
attacked, a tardiness of zeal, amounting nearly to torpor, secures, with few
exceptions, impunity to the assailant; whereas any exposure of the latter draws
forth a malignity of revenge which is the certain fore-runner of persecution.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Indeed, the inveteracy of the discontented, of that class which includes all
those who aspire to the possession of place and power, and are little scrupulous
about the means of attaining them; and all the determined revolutionists or
subverters of established institutions, may be traced to a natural source. Unable
to support by reason a cause which reason disavows, unable to strengthen
by arguments positions which set all argument at defiance, it becomes their
business to inflame by passion and to dazzle with sophistry. Hence arises an
extreme facility of exposing their weakness and detecting their infamy, and
not having the means of resisting such exposure, being wholly destitute of the
sentiments which are necessary for a successful reply, they are reduced to the
degrading alternative of abandoning the field to a triumphant adversary, or of
seeking, by the adoption of violent measures, to punish the opponent whom they
did not dare to encounter. This it is that renders revenge an active principle in
<em>their</em> minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first step taken by the Spanish ambassador was an application to the
federal government to prosecute our author “for certain matters published in
his Gazette against himself and that poor, unfortunate, and humbled mortal,
Charles IV., King of Spain”. The government consented, and Peter was
accordingly bound over to appear in the federal district court before <em>Judge
Peters</em>. Don Carlos, however, soon found that his prosecution would be more
likely to succeed, if brought in a district where the defendant had more
personal enemies, and where the people were more generally disposed to the
adoption of revolutionary principles. A memorial was, accordingly, “delivered
in to the federal government, requesting that the trial might come on before the
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, of which Court <em>McKean is Chief Justice</em>”. Of
this <em>republican</em> Judge our author gives such an account as must convey to
English minds a strange idea of the administration of <em>republican</em> Justice. It is
to be found in P. <a href='#Page_22'>22</a>—When Britons contemplate the character here delineated,
and contrast it with the characters of their own Judges to which even the
licentious tongue of faction has not dared to impute the smallest stain, their
bosoms must glow with satisfaction of the most exalted kind; they must exult
in the superior excellence of that form of government and of those laws which
effectually secure them from the evils of a vicious, corrupt, or partial distribution
of justice. After giving an historical detail of the proceedings against him,
accompanied by copies of the warrant to apprehend him, the imputed libels, the
bill of indictment, and the Judge’s charge, Peter exclaims—“This, when it
comes to be served up in Britain, will be a dish for a king. The royalists will
lick their lips, and the republicans will cry, God bless us! The emigrations
<em>for liberty’s sake</em> will cease, and we shall have nothing but the pure unadulterated
dregs of Newgate and the Fleet, the candidates for Tyburn and Botany Bay—Blessed
cargo! All <em>patriots</em> to the backbone: true philanthropists and universal
citizens: fit for any place but England in this world and heaven in the next!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But, notwithstanding the Judge’s charge, the most partial and scandalous
charge, we conceive, that ever was delivered <em>out of France</em>, the Grand Jury refused
to find the bill, and the prosecution of course ceased. The Judge, not
less disappointed than the prosecutor, on this occasion, took an early opportunity—to
his infamy be it recorded!—of declaring from the Bench that the
Grand Jury would not <em>do their duty</em>. What would the disaffected in this country
say were any British Judge to use such language? The gross imputations cast
upon the character of our author by this <em>impartial</em> Judge, have extorted from
Peter a tribute of justice to himself which the occasion most amply justifies.
As the account here given perfectly accords with all the information we have
received from persons of undoubted veracity who know him well, and as it
fully corroborates the opinion we ourselves have formed of him, from an attentive
perusal of his publications, we shall extract it for the satisfaction of our
readers:—“It hardly ever becomes a man to say much of his private character
or concerns; but on this occasion I trust I shall be indulged for a moment. I
will say, and I will make that saying good, whosoever shall oppose it, that I
never attacked any one, whose private character is not, in every light in which
it can possibly be viewed as far beneath mine as infamy is beneath honour.
Nay, I defy the city of Philadelphia, populous as it is, and respectable as are
many of its inhabitants, to produce me a single man who is more sober, industrious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>or honest; who is a kinder husband, a tenderer father, a better
master, a fonder friend, or (though last not least) a more zealous and faithful
subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most certainly it is unseemly in any one to say this much of himself unless
compelled to it by some public outrage on his character; but when the accusation
is made notorious so ought the defence; and I do again and again repeat,
that I fear not a comparison between my character and that of any man in this
city: no, not even with that of the very Judge, who held me as the worst of
miscreants. His Honour is welcome, if he please, to carry this comparison into
<em>all</em> the actions of our lives, public and <em>domestic</em>, and to extend it beyond ourselves
to <em>every branch of our families</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As to my writing, I never did slander any one, if the promulgation of useful
truths be not slander. Innocence and virtue I have often endeavoured to defend,
but I never defamed either. I have, indeed, stripped the close-drawn veil of
hypocrisy; I have ridiculed the follies, and lashed the vices of thousands, and
have done it sometimes perhaps with a rude and violent hand. But these are
not the days for gentleness and mercy. Such as is the temper of the foe, such
must be that of his opponent. Seeing myself published as a rogue, <em>and my wife
a whore</em>; being persecuted with such infamous, such base and hellish calumny
in the <em>philanthropic</em> city of Philadelphia, merely for asserting <em>the truth</em> respecting
others, was not calculated, I assure you, to sweeten my temper, and turn my
ink into honey-dew.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My attachment to order and good government, nothing but the impudence
of Jacobinism can deny. The object not only of my own publications, but also
of all those which I have introduced or encouraged, from the first moment that
I appeared on the public scene to the present day, has been to lend some aid in
stemming the torrent of anarchy and confusion. To undeceive the misguided,
by tearing the mask from the artful and ferocious villains who owing to the
infatuation of the poor, and the supineness of the rich, have made such fearful
progress in the destruction of all that is amiable and good and sacred among
men. To the government of this country in particular it has been my constant
study to yield all the support in my power. When that government, or the
worthy men who administer it have been traduced and vilified, I have stood
forward in their defence, and that too, in times when its friends were some of
them locked up in silence, and others giving way to the audacious violence of
its foes. Not that I am so foolishly vain as to attribute to my illiterate voter a
thousandth part of the merit my friends are inclined to allow it. As I wrote
the other day to a gentleman who had paid me some compliments on this score,
‘I should never look on my family with a dry eye if I did not hope to outlive my
works’. They are mere transitory beings to which the revolutionary storm has
given life, and which with that storm will expire. But, what I contend for and
what nobody can deny, I have done all that laid in my power, all that I was
able by any means to accomplish in order to counteract the nefarious effects of
the enemies of the American government and nation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“With respect to religion, altho’ Mr. M’Kean was pleased to number it among
the things that were in danger from the licentiousness of the press, and of
course from poor <em>me</em>, I think it would puzzle the devil himself to produce from
my writings, a single passage, which could, by all the powers of perversion be
twisted into an attack upon it. But it would on the contrary be extremely easy
to prove, that I have at all times, when an opportunity offered, repelled the
attacks of its enemies, the abominable battalions of Deists and Atheists, with
all my heart, with all my mind, with all my soul, and with all my strength.
The bitterest drop in my pen has ever been bestowed upon them; because, of
all the foes of the human race, I look upon them, after the devil, as being the
greatest and most dreadful. Not a sacrilegious plunderer from Henry VIII. to
Condorcet, and from Condorcet to the impious Sans-culottes of France, has
escaped my censure. All those, who have attempted to degrade religion whether
by open insults and cruelties to the clergy, by blasphemous publications or by
the more dangerous poison of the malignant modern philosophy, I have ranked
amongst the most infamous of mankind, and have treated them accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the concluding part of his tract the author clearly convicts the Judge of
the most decided and most flagrant partiality. He quotes a number of infamous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>libels, on religious and political subjects, which had never roused the indignation,
nor even excited the censure, of those whose duty it is to preserve the
public peace and to enforce a due observance of the laws. If, indeed, we were
to judge, from this specimen, of the mode of administring justice in America, in
matters of libel, we should conclude, that every degree of licentiousness is allowed
to those who seek to debauch the minds of the people, to seduce them from
their allegiance, and to dissolve every tie which religion and morality have
formed for the happiness of men in a social state, while the upright supporters
of virtue, whose labours are directed to the prevention of anarchy and rebellion,
by detecting the views and exposing the machinations of their abettors, are the
sole objects not merely of <em>pro</em>secution but of <em>per</em>secution.</p>

<p class='c009'>The abuse bestowed on the mild and beneficent sovereigns of these realms
by the Democratic factions in the American Congress, is almost equal in severity
to the censures lavished by some members of opposition during the <em>last</em> parliament
in the British Senate, on the Kings of Prussia and Hungary, <em>before</em> those
monarchs had become allies of <em>France</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following extracts will, at once, afford a criterion of the political principles
of public men, in the State of Pennsylvania, and a curious specimen of
republican <em>morality</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The <em>Governor</em> (Mifflin) attended at a civic festival, when the following
toasts were drunk, which were published in most of the newspapers.<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c024'><sup>[331]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Those <em>illustrious citizens</em> sent to Botany Bay. May they be <em>speedily
recalled</em> by their country in <em>the day of her regeneration</em>.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘May the spirit of parliamentary reform in Britain and Ireland <em>burst
the bonds of corruption, and overwhelm the foes of liberty</em>.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans-culottes</span></i> of France. May the robes of <em>all</em> the <em>Emperors</em>, <em>Kings</em>,
<em>Princes</em>, and <em>Potentates</em> [not excepting the <em>King of Spain</em>] now employed in
suppressing the flame of liberty, be cut up to make breeches.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is pretty ‘<em>decent</em>’ in a <em>Governor</em>; but without stopping to remark on
the peculiar <em>decency</em> of his toasting a gang of <em>convicts</em>, let us come to another
instance of his conduct, full as ‘<em>decent</em>’ as this.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the civic festival, held in this city in 1794, to celebrate the dethronement
of ‘our great and good ally, Louis XVI.’ there were ‘assembled,’ according
to the ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès verbal</span></i>’ which was sent to the Paris convention, ‘the <span class='fss'>CHIEFS</span>,
<em>civil and military</em>’. This <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès verbal</span></i> contains a letter to the convention, in
which the following honourable mention is made of the governor. ‘The
Governor of Pennsylvania, that <em>ardent friend of the French republic</em>, was present,
and partook of <em>all our enthusiasm</em> and <em>all our sentiments</em>.’<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c024'><sup>[332]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe they spoke truth; for the cannons of the State were fired, and
military companies, with drums beating and colours flying, attended the
execrable fête, one of the ceremonies of which was <em>burning the English flag</em>; and
as to the sentiments contained in the <em>oaths</em> and <em>speeches</em> (for there were both)
they abounded in insults towards almost all the princes of the earth, but
particularly the King of Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A Judge of Pennsylvania, <span class='sc'>Redman</span>, was, in November, 1795, caught
thieving in the shop of <span class='sc'>Mr. Folwell</span>, the dry-goods merchant in Front Street.
<span class='sc'>Mr. Folwell</span> detected him, took the money ($300) from him, and kicked him
into the street. His <em>friends</em>, among the most intimate of whom was His
Excellency the Governor, advised him to <em>retire</em>; and he is still living at his ease
about 20 miles from the city. No justice was ever done to him; he was never
censured, not even in the newspapers! Such is the cowardly, base, and worthless
press of America. Such are <em>republican judges</em>, and such is republican morality!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>But this is not the worst. I know a Judge who <em>committed murder</em>! wilful murder,
and that, too, previous to his appointment by this our republican Governor!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I only give a sort of hint here. One day or other if it pleases God to spare
my life, I will publish such a collection of facts as will shock the universe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A Pennsylvania <em>Judge’s wife</em> had, a little while ago, a child, by a man who
kept a livery stable. The <em>lady</em> says, the stableman is the best of the two and so
has married him, though <em>his Honour</em> is still living. I need not name the parties,
for though the cowardly newspapers have never noticed the affair it is notorious
enough.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are more bastards born annually in the single state of Pennsylvania, than
in all the British dominions: and as to cuckoldom, I will only say that every
paper teems with <em>advertisements of wives eloped</em> from the bed and board of their
husbands. I do not hence insinuate that there are <em>no good people</em> here. There
are many. As many as in most countries; but then people will, and do allow,
that the morals of the country are approaching fast to that state, which has
never yet failed to prove the ruin of every thing held in esteem amongst men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In proving the falsehood of the assertion so frequently repeated, as well on this
as on the other side of the Atlantic, that “in <em>America</em> the press is <em>free</em> and truth
is <em>not</em> a libel,” our author adverts to a letter of <span class='sc'>Dr. Priestley’s</span> on that subject
which he promises hereafter to expose more fully (a promise which we trust
he will not forget); and then introduces the following curious anecdote, which
we extract for the benefit of the Doctor’s political friends and admirers in
Europe. “But since the Doctor wrote that letter it seems experience has changed
his opinion. He has suffered the just punishment of his malignancy against his
country; he has been cheated, neglected, and scorned. He is now in an obscurity
hardly penetrable; he is reduced to poverty and bursting with vexation” (may
a restless spirit of innovation, springing from, and nourished by, a bigotted
vanity and a turbulent pride ever experience a similar fate)! All this has had
an effect; and I will state as a fact, which I call upon him to deny if he can,
that he has lately declared “that <em>Republican governments are the most arbitrary in
the world</em>”! This <span class='sc'>Machiavel</span> had said before, and this all unprejudiced men of
reading and observation had long since admitted; but, we confess we little expected
to hear <span class='sc'>Doctor Priestley</span> subscribe to the creed of the one, or to the
acknowledgments of the other. Adversity, however, is an able advocate in the
cause of <span class='fss'>TRUTH</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Address to the People of England, which is prefixed to the publication,
is short, but pointed and expressive. It breathes the true spirit of a Briton.
Of the literary merit of the work, after the ample analysis which we have given
of its contents, and the extracts which we have made, little remains to be said.
We agree with the publisher, who in the Advertisement says: “The author
has been more anxious to strengthen his arguments than to polish his style, to
convince the judgment than to flatter the taste,” but those critics must be more
“<em>delicate</em>” or fastidious who can reject substantial advantages for fanciful defects.
Though Peter aim not at embellishments, he possesses great strength
and energy of language, and generally writes with more accuracy than most of
the American authors, who, be it observed, have a phraseology peculiar to
themselves. This tract contains much important information, and we strenuously
recommend it to the serious perusal of our countrymen; particularly to such
of them as are disposed to question the superior advantages which they enjoy,
over <span class='fss'>ALL</span> republican states under our own well-poised and limited <span class='fss'>MONARCHY</span>.
The following admonitions with which the author concludes, will, we trust,
have a due effect on the minds of those to whom they are addressed. “Such,
<em>Britons</em>, is the fruit of republican government <em>here</em>; not among the apish and
wolfish French, but among a people descended from the same ancestors as yourselves.
When your monarchial government bears such fruits, let it, I say, be
hewn down and cast into the fire; but till that disgraceful and dreadful day
comes, watch over it with care and defend it to the last drop of your blood,
preserve it as you would a golden casket, the apple of your eye, or the last dear
gift of your dying parents. With this I conclude, praying the God of our fathers
to lead you in the practice of all their virtues, to give wisdom to your minds and
strength to your arms, to keep you firm and united, honest and generous, loyal,
brave, and free; but above all, to preserve you from the desolating and degrading
curse of revolutionary madness and modern <em>republicanism</em>.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PETER PORCUPINE’S WILL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c025'>[By <span class='sc'>William Cobbett</span>. Published in <cite>The Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine</cite>;
or Monthly Political and Literary Censor: from July to December, 1798. Vol.
i., pp. 725–8.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c007'>In the name of Fun, Amen. I <span class='sc'>Peter Porcupine</span>, Pamphleteer and Newsmonger,
being (as yet) sound both in body and in mind, do, this fifteenth day of
<em>April</em>, in the Year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-seven,
make, declare, and publish, this my <span class='sc'>Last Will and Testament</span>, in manner,
form, and substance following; to wit:</p>

<p class='c048'><span class='sc'>In Primis</span>,</p>

<p class='c007'>I leave my body to Doctor Michael Lieb, a member of the Legislature of
Pennsylvania, to be by him dissected (if he knows how to do it) in presence of
the Rump of the Democratic Society. In it they will find a heart that held them
in abhorrence, that never palpitated at their threats, and that, to its last beat,
bade them defiance. But my chief motive for making this bequest is, that my
spirit may look down with contempt on their cannibal-like triumph over a
breathless corpse.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> As I make no doubt that the above said Doctor Lieb (and some other
Doctors that I could mention) would like very well to skin me, I request that
they, or one of them may do it, and that the said Lieb’s father may tan my
skin; after which I desire my Executors to have seven copies of my Works complete,
bound in it, one copy to be presented to the Five Sultans of France, one to
each of their Divans, one to the Governor of Pennsylvania, to Citizens Maddison,
Giles, and Gallatin one each, and the remaining one to the Democratic Society of
Philadelphia, to be carefully preserved among their archives.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councils of the City of Philadelphia, I
bequeath all the sturdy young hucksters, who infest the market, and who to
maintain their bastards, tax the honest inhabitants many thousand pounds
annually. I request them to take them into their worshipful keeping; to chasten
their bodies for the good of their souls; and moreover to keep a sharp look-out
after their gallants; and remind the latter of the old proverb: <em>Touch pot, touch
penny</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To T—— J——son, Philosopher, I leave a curious Norway Spider, with
a hundred legs and nine pair of eyes; likewise the first black cut-throat general
he can catch hold of, to be flead alive, in order to determine with more certainty
the real cause of the dark colour of his skin; and should the said T—— J——son
survive Banneker the Almanack Maker; I request he will get the brains of said
Philomath carefully dissected, to satisfy the world in what respects they differ
from those of a white man.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, I will and bequeath a
correct copy of Thornton’s plan for abolishing the use of the English language,
and for introducing in its stead a republican one, the representative characters of
which bear a strong resemblance to pot-hooks and hangers; and for the discovery
of which plan, the said society did, in the year 1793, grant to the said
language maker 500 dollars premium. It is my earnest desire, that the copy of
this valuable performance, which I hereby present, may be shown to all the
travelling literati, as a proof of the ingenuity of the author and of the wisdom of
the society.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To Doctor Benjamin Rush, I will and bequeath a copy of <cite>The Censor</cite>
for January, 1797; but, upon the express condition, that he does not in anywise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>or guise, either at the time of my death, or <em>Six months after</em>, pretend to speak,
write, or publish an eulogium on me, my calling or character, either literary,
military, civil, or political.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To my dear fellow labourer Noah Webster, “gentleman-citizen,”
Esq. and News-man, I will and bequeath a prognosticating barometer of curious
construction and great utility, by which, at a single glance, the said Noah will
be able to discern the exact state that the public mind will be in in the ensuing
year, and will thereby be enabled to <em>trim by degrees</em> and not expose himself to
detection, as he now does by his sudden lee-shore tacks. I likewise bequeath to
the said “gentleman-citizen,” six Spanish milled dollars, to be expended on a
new plate of his portrait at the head of his spelling book, that which graces it at
present being so ugly that it scares the children from their lessons; but this
legacy is to be paid him only upon condition that he leave out the title of
<em>’Squire</em>, at the bottom of said picture, which is extremely odious in an American
school-book, and must inevitably tend to corrupt the political principles of the
republican babies that behold it. And I do most earnestly desire, exhort and
conjure the said ’Squire news-man, to change the title of his paper, <cite>The Minerva</cite>,
for that of <cite>The Political Centaur</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To F. A. Mughlenburg, Esq., Speaker of a late house of Representatives
of the United States, I leave a most superbly finished statue of Janus.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To Tom the Tinker, I leave a liberty-cap, a tricoloured cockade, a
wheel-barrow full of oysters, and a hogshead of grog: I also leave him three
blank checks on the bank of Pennsylvania, leaving to him the task of <em>filling
them up</em>; requesting him, however, to be rather more merciful than he has
shown himself heretofore.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To the Governor of Pennsylvania, and to the late President and
Cashier of the Bank of the said State, as to joint Legatees, I will and bequeath
that good old proverb: <em>Honesty is the best policy</em>. And this legacy I have chosen
for these worthy gentlemen, as the only thing about which I am sure they will
never disagree.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To T—— Coxe, of Philadelphia, citizen, I will and bequeath a crown
of hemlock, as a recompense for his attempt to throw an odium on the
administration of General Washington; and I most positively enjoin my
Executors, to see that the said crown be shaped exactly like that which this
spindle-shanked legatee wore before Gen. Howe, when he made his triumphal
entry into Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To Thomas Lord Bradford (otherwise called Goosy Tom), Bookseller,
Printer, News-man, and member of the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia,
I will and bequeath a copy of the peerage of Great Britain, in order that the
said Lord Thomas may the more exactly ascertain what probability there is of
his succeeding to the seat, which his noble relation now fills in the House of Lords.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To all and singular the authors in the United States, whether they
write verse or prose, I will and bequeath a copy of my Life and Adventures; and
I advise the said authors to study with particular care the 40th and 41st pages
thereof; more especially and above all things, I exhort and conjure them never
to <em>publish it together</em>, though the bookseller should be a saint.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To Edmund Randolph, Esq., late Secretary of State, to Mr. J. A.
Dallas, Secretary of the State of Pennsylvania, and to His Excellency, Thomas
Miffin, Governor of the said unfortunate State, I will and bequeath, to each of
them, a copy of the sixteenth paragraph of Fauchet’s <em>intercepted letter</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To Citizen John Swanwick, member of Congress, by the will and
consent of the sovereign people, I leave bills of Exchange on London to an
enormous amount; they are <em>all protested</em>, indeed, but if properly managed, may be
turned to good account. I likewise bequeath to the said John a small treatise
by an Italian author, wherein the secret of pleasing the ladies is developed,
and reduced to a mere mechanical operation, without the least dependence on
the precarious aid of the passions. Hoping that these instances of my liberality
will produce, in the mind of the little legislature, effects quite different from
those produced therein by the King of Great Britain’s pension to his parents.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To the Editors of the <cite>Boston Chronicle</cite>, the <cite>New York Argus</cite>, and the
<cite>Philadelphia Merchants’ Advertiser</cite>, I will and bequeath one ounce of modesty and
love of truth, to be equally divided between them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>I should have been more liberal in this bequest, were I not well assured,
that one ounce is more than they will ever make use of.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To Franklin Bache, Editor of the <cite>Aurora of Philadelphia</cite>, I will and
bequeath a small bundle of French assignats, which I brought with me from
the country of equality. If these should be too light in value for his pressing
exigencies, I desire my executors, or any one of them, to bestow on him a
second part to what he has lately received in Southwark: and as a further
proof of my good will and affection, I request him to accept of a gag and a
brand new pair of fetters, which, if he should refuse, I will and bequeath him
in lieu thereof—my malediction.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To my beloved countrymen, the people of Old England, I will and
bequeath a copy of Doctor Priestley’s <cite>Charity Sermon for the benefit of poor Emigrants</cite>;
and to the said preaching philosopher himself, I bequeath a heart full
of disappointment, grief, and despair.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To the good people of France, who remain attached to their sovereign,
particularly to those among whom I was hospitably received, I bequeath each a
good strong dagger: hoping most sincerely that they may yet find courage
enough to carry them to the hearts of their abominable tyrants.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To Citizen M——oe, I will and bequeath my chamber looking-glass.
It is a plain but exceeding true mirror; in it he will see the exact likeness of a
traitor, who has bartered the honour and interest of his country to a perfidious
and savage enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To the Republican Britons, who have fled from the hands of justice
in their own country, and who are a scandal, a nuisance, and a disgrace to this,
I bequeath hunger and nakedness, scorn and reproach; and I do hereby positively
enjoin on my executors to contribute five hundred dollars towards the
erection of gallowses and gibbets, for the accommodation of the said imported
patriots, when the legislators of this unhappy state shall have the wisdom to
countenance such useful establishments.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> My friend, J. T. Callender, the runaway from Scotland, is, of course,
a partaker in the last mentioned legacy; but as a particular mark of my attention,
I will and bequeath him twenty feet of pine plank, which I request my
executors to see made into a pillory, to be kept for his particular use, till a
gibbet can be prepared.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To Tom Paine, the author of <cite>Common Sense</cite>, <cite>Rights of Man</cite>, <cite>Age of
Reason</cite>, and a <cite>Letter to General Washington</cite>, I bequeath a strong hempen collar,
as the only legacy I can think of that is worthy of him as well as best adapted
to render his death in some measure as infamous as his life: and I do hereby
direct and order my Executors to send it to him by the first safe conveyance
with my compliments, and request that he would make use of it without delay,
that the national razor may not be disgraced by the head of such a monster.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To the gaunt outlandish orator, vulgarly called the Political Sinner,
who in the just order of things follows next after the last mentioned legatee,
I bequeath the honour of partaking in his catastrophe; that in their deaths, as
well as in their lives, all the world may exclaim: “<em>See how rogues hang together</em>”.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To all and singular the good people of these States, I leave peace,
union, abundance, happiness, untarnished honour, and an unconquerable everlasting
hatred to the French Revolutionists and their destructive abominable
principles.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Item.</em> To each of my Subscribers I leave a <em>quill</em>, hoping that in their hands
it may become a sword against every thing that is hostile to the government
and independence of their country.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Lastly.</em> To my three brothers, Paul, Simon, and Dick, I leave my whole
estate, as well real as personal (first paying the foregoing legacies) to be equally
divided between them, share and share alike. And I do hereby make and constitute
my said three brothers the Executors of this my <span class='fss'>LAST WILL</span>; to see the
same performed, according to its true intent and meaning, as far as in their
power lies.</p>

<p class='c007'>[As the virulent style of political writing prevalent ninety years ago is now
but little known, the present edition of <cite>The Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</cite> seemed a
convenient medium for giving some specimens of it which appeared in <cite>The Anti-Jacobin
Review and Magazine</cite>, a work conducted on the same principles, but by
different writers, and with the cognizance of the government. Two of them
were by <span class='sc'>W. Cobbett</span>, who, had he been less arrogant and contentious, and more
consistent, would have been, in the words of Lord Dalling, “a very great man

“The Duke of Bedford’s energetic and capacious mind,” says

superior to bad education and disadvantages for forming his

butchered at Lyons, and this once magnificent city almost
levelled to the ground, by the command of a wretched actor
(<span class='sc'>Collot d’Herbois</span>), whom they had formerly hissed from the
stage. From the same authorities we learn, that at Nantz
27,000 persons, of both sexes, were murdered; chiefly by
drowning them in plugged boats. The waters of the Loire
became putrid, and were forbidden to be drunk, by the savages
who conducted the massacre:—that at Paris 150,000, and in
La Vendée 300,000 persons were destroyed.—Upon the whole,
the French themselves acknowledge, that <span class='fss'>TWO MILLIONS</span> of
human beings (exclusive of the military) have been sacrificed
to the principles of <span class='sc'>Equality</span> and the <span class='sc'>Rights of Man</span>: 250,000

is wholly unintelligible without a note. And we are afraid the
note will be wholly incredible, unless the reader can fortunately
procure the book to which it refers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the “Part of a Letter,” which was published by <span class='sc'>Mr. Robt.
Adair</span>, in answer to <span class='sc'>Mr. Burke’s</span> “Letter to the D. of B.,”
nothing is so remarkable as the studious imitation of Mr.
Burke’s style.</p>

<p class='c007'>His vehemence, and his passion, and his irony, his wild
imagery, his far-sought illustrations, his rolling and lengthened
periods, and the short quick pointed sentences in which he
often condenses as much wisdom and wit as others would expand
through pages, or through volumes,—all these are carefully
kept in view by his opponent, though not always very
artificially copied or applied.</p>

<p class='c007'>But imitators are liable to be led strangely astray; and never
was there an instance of a more complete mistake of a plain
meaning, than that which this line is intended to illustrate—a
mistake no less than that of a <em>coffin</em> for a <em>corpse</em>. This is hard
to believe or to comprehend—but you shall hear.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mr. Burke</span>, in one of his publications, had talked of the
French “<em>unplumbing</em> the dead in order to destroy the living,”—by
which he intended, without doubt, not metaphorically, but
literally, “<em>stripping the dead of their</em> <span class='fss'>LEADEN COFFINS</span>, <em>and then
making them</em> (<em>not the</em> <span class='fss'>DEAD</span> <em>but the</em> <span class='fss'>COFFINS</span>) <em>into bullets</em>”. A
circumstance perfectly notorious at the time the book was
written.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this does not satisfy our author. He determines to
retort <span class='sc'>Mr. Burke’s</span> own words upon him; and unfortunately
“reaching at a metaphor,” where <span class='sc'>Mr. Burke</span> only intended a
fact, he falls into the little mistake above mentioned, and by a
stroke of his pen transmutes the illustrious <span class='sc'>Head</span> of the house
of <span class='sc'>Russell</span> into a metal, to which it is not for us to say how
near or how remote his affinity may possibly have been. He
writes thus—“<em>If</em> <span class='sc'>Mr. Burke</span> <em>had been content with ‘unplumbing’
a dead Russell, and hewing</em> HIM (observe—not the coffin, but
<span class='fss'>HIM</span>—the old dead Russell himself) <em>into grape and canister, to
sweep down the whole generation of his descendants</em>,” <em>&amp;c., &amp;c.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>The thing is scarcely credible; but <span class='fss'>IT IS SO</span>! We write
with the book open before us.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Lord Moira.</em>—“My Lords, I rise to return my thanks to the Noble Lord who
spoke last. I can testify the truth of all he has asserted. At the time of the
Insurrection in the North, I had frequent and intimate conversations with that
celebrated enchanter, <em>Moll Coggin</em>. I have often seen her riding on a black ram
with a blue tail. Once I endeavoured to fire at her, but my gun melted in my
hand into a clear jelly. This jelly I tasted, and if it had been a little more acid,
it would have been most excellent. The Noble Lords may laugh; but I declare
the fact upon my veracity, which has never been doubted. Once I pursued this
fiend into my ale cellar: she rode instantly out of my sight into the bung-hole
of a beer barrel. She was at that time mounted on her black ram with the
blue tail. Some time after, my servants were much surprised to find their ale
full of <em>blue hairs</em>. I was not surprised, as I knew the blue <em>hairs</em> were the hairs
of the ram’s <em>blue tail</em>. Noble Lords may stare, but the fact is as I relate it.
This <em>Moll Coggin</em> was the fiend who raised the <em>Oak-boys</em> to rebellion. I was also
well acquainted with the two Cow-boys mentioned by the Noble Lord; they
were my tenants, and were certainly endowed with supernatural powers. I
have known one of them tear up by the roots an Oak two hundred feet high,
and bear it upright on his head four miles! his party were on that account
called Oak-boys. Noble Lords may laugh, but I speak from certain knowledge.
The Oak-tree grew in my garden, and I have often seen five hundred Swans
perching on its boughs; these swans were remarkable for destroying all the
snipes in the country—they flew faster than any snipe I ever saw, and you may
imagine a small bird could make but a feeble resistance in the talons of a swan.
I hope, my Lords, you will pardon my wandering a little from the present subject,”

house by the road-side—they went and ordered it to be extinguished immediately:
the people of the house begged that the light might be suffered to remain
because there was a child belonging to the family in convulsion fits, who must
expire for want of help if the people were to be without fire and candle; <em>but this
request</em> <span class='fss'>HAD NO EFFECT</span>.” <cite>Lord Moira’s Speech in the House of Lords, November 22,
1797.</cite> This statement was, however, satisfactorily disproved. The incident
forms a feature in the accompanying engraving. Notwithstanding official
denials, it has long been admitted that the conduct of the Soldiery in Ireland
was simply infamous. Billeting on Catholics and reputed malcontents of the
better class appears to have been invariably as an unlimited licence for robbery,
devastation, ravishment, and, in case of resistance, murder. Sir Ralph Abercromby,
on assuming the command of the army in Ireland, declared, in general
orders, that their habits and discipline were such as to render them “formidable
to everybody but the enemy”. The just severity of this phrase was confirmed
by the subsequent experience of Lord Cornwallis.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

he was a little man, his face red, covered with pimples; always dressed in the
blue and buff uniform, with his hat on one side, copying the air of his master,
to whom he was a prodigious foil, and ready to execute any commissions, which
in those days were somewhat complicated.” He was private secretary and
keeper of the privy purse to King George IV. when Prince Regent, was sworn
of the Privy Council, and created a Baronet, 7th August, 1817, with remainder,
in default of male issue, to his brother. <span class='sc'>Sir John</span> died 12th September, 1817,
the title devolving on his brother <span class='sc'>Thomas</span>, a distinguished military officer, who
was Adjutant-General of Her Majesty’s forces in India, Lieut.-Gov. of Portsmouth,
Commander-in-Chief of the Bombay Army, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Sir John M‘Mahon</span> left a large personal property, amounting to £90,000.

esteemed friend, £2000; and with my last prayers for the glory and happiness
of the best-hearted man in the world, the <span class='sc'>Prince Regent</span>, I bequeath him the

in her gallery the bust of Fox between those of Demosthenes
and Cicero, as a token of gratitude for his exertions in defeating
the project of <span class='sc'>Pitt</span>, who, in conjunction with Prussia
and Holland, had, in 1791, prepared a powerful armament
to compel her to give up Ockzakow, which she had seized.
The Court party delighted in stigmatizing <span class='sc'>Fox</span> as the modern
<em>Catiline</em>. “But the part which he took in parliament subsequent
to 1793, (says <em>Sir N. W. Wraxall</em>), and the eulogiums
lavished by him on the French Revolution, soon changed the
Empress’s tone. She caused the bust to be removed; and
when reproached with such a change in her conduct, she replied,
‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’étoit Monsieur Fox de <em>Quatre-vingt-onze</em> que j’ai placé dans
mon cabinet</span>’.”—<cite>Wraxall’s Posthumous Memoirs</cite>, vol. 1, pp. 435,

<p class='c007'>“It seems to have escaped general notice, (says Sir James
Prior in his Life of Burke), that the misfortunes of Poland in
her final partition may be, in some degree, attributed, however
undesignedly on their part, to Mr. Fox and the Opposition,
in the strong and unusual means made use of to thwart Mr.
Pitt in the business of Ockzakow. They lay claim, it is true,
to the merit of having prevented war on that occasion. But
if war had then taken place with England for one act of violence
comparatively trivial, Russia, in all probability, would
not have ventured upon a second and still greater aggression,
involving the existence of a nation, with the certainty of a
second war. Nothing, after all, might have saved Poland from
the combination then on foot against her; but it is certain
that Mr. Pitt, from recent experience, had little encouragement
to make the attempt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a curious circumstance that, though the <em>plate</em> illustrating
these <em>Lines</em> was published, according to its inscription,
on the 17th March, 1792, the five stanzas engraved on it are
identical with those which appeared in the <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite> of
12th Feb., 1798, though these were introduced as written “by
an English Traveller just [<em>sic</em>] returned from Petersburgh”.</p>

<p class='c007'>Assuming the date on the engraving to be correct, we might
account for the <em>parachronism</em> on the supposition that the author
of the earlier <em>plate-stanzas</em> availed himself of the appearance
of the <cite>Lines written under the Bust of Charles Fox at the Crown
and Anchor to reproduce them</cite>—six years afterwards—with a few
verbal alterations, to adapt them to a later period—and with an

of the age. After his acquittal he went about the country lecturing.
Sometimes he was attended by numerous admirers, but more frequently hooted
and pelted by the mob. In order to escape prosecution for sedition, he took as
his subject Greek and Roman history, and had ingenuity enough to give such a
colouring to events and characters, as to render the application to living persons
and present events an exciting mental exercise. I heard one or two of these
lectures, and thought very differently of him then from what I thought afterwards.
When, however, he found his popularity on the wane, and more stringent
laws had been passed, to which he individually gave occasion, he came to
the prudent resolution of abandoning his vagrant habits, and leading a farmer’s
life in a beautiful place near Brecon.... He was an amiable man in private
life, an affectionate husband, and a fond father. He altogether mistook his
talents—he told me without reserve that he believed he should establish his
name among the epic poets of England; and it is a curious thing considering
his own view’s that he thought the establishment of Christianity, and the British
Constitution, very appropriate subjects for his poem.... <span class='sc'>Thelwall</span>, unlike
Hardy, had the weakness of vanity; but he was a perfectly honest man, and

wore hair-powder and a queue, he had the courage to cut his hair short, and to
renounce powder, which he never used except when going to court. In his
youth he led a most licentious life, having frequently passed the whole night in
excesses of every kind, and even lain down, when intoxicated, occasionally to
sleep in the streets, or on a block of wood. In cleanliness he was negligent to
so great a degree that he rarely made use of water for the purpose of bodily refreshment
and comfort.” Complaining one day to Dudley North that he was a
martyr to the rheumatism, and had ineffectually tried every remedy for its
relief, “Pray, my lord,” said he, “did you ever try a clean shirt?” It must not

<em>curves</em> of the higher order over a pebbly channel, inlaid with
<em>differential calculi</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the following six lines he has confined himself to a strict
explanation of the theory, according to which lines are supposed
to be generated by the motion of points, planes by the lateral
motion of lines, and solids from planes, by a similar process.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Quære</em>—Whether a practical application of this theory would
not enable us to account for the genesis or original formation of
space itself, in the same manner in which Dr. Darwin has
traced the whole of the organized creation to his six filaments—Vide
<cite>Zoonomia</cite>. We may conceive the whole of our present
universe to have been originally concentred in a single point;
we may conceive this primeval point, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">punctum saliens</span></i> of the
universe, evolving itself by its own energies, to have moved
forward in a right line, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i>, till it grew tired; after
which the right line which it had generated would begin to put
itself in motion in a lateral direction, describing an area of
infinite extent. This area, as soon as it became conscious of
its own existence, would begin to ascend or descend, according
as its specific gravity might determine it, forming an immense
solid space filled with vacuum, and capable of containing the
present existing universe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Space being thus obtained, and presenting a suitable nidus,
or receptacle for the generation of chaotic matter, an immense
deposit of it would gradually be accumulated; after which, the
filament of <em>fire</em> being produced in the chaotic mass by an <em>idiosyncrasy</em>,
or self-formed habit, analogous to fermentation, <em>explosion</em>
would take place; <em>suns</em> would be shot from the central
chaos; <em>planets</em> from <em>suns</em>; and <em>satellites</em> from <em>planets</em>. In this
state of things the filament of <em>organization</em> would begin to exert
itself in those independent masses which, in proportion to their
bulk, exposed the greatest surface to the action of <em>light</em> and <em>heat</em>.
This filament, after an infinite series of ages, would begin to
<em>ramify</em>, and its viviparous offspring would diversify their forms
and habits, so as to accommodate themselves to the various
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">incunabula</span></i> which Nature had prepared for them. Upon this
view of things it seems highly probable that the first effort of
Nature terminated in the production of vegetables, and that
these, being abandoned to their own <em>energies</em>, by degrees
detached themselves from the surface of the earth, and supplied
themselves with wings or feet, according as their different propensities
determined them in favour of aerial and terrestrial
existence. Others, by an inherent disposition to society and
civilization, and by a stronger effort of <em>volition</em>, would become
men. These, in time, would restrict themselves to the use of
their <em>hind feet</em>; their <em>tails</em> would gradually rub off by sitting
in their caves or huts, as soon as they arrived at a domesticated
state; they would invent <em>language</em> and the use of <em>fire</em>,
with our present and hitherto imperfect system of <em>society</em>.
In the meanwhile, the <em>Fuci</em> and <em>Algæ</em>, with the <em>Corallines</em>
and <em>Madrepores</em>, would transform themselves into <em>fish</em>, and
would gradually populate all the submarine portion of the
globe.</p>

to the end, whether of ornament or defence, which they could

this instance the mice were dead, and that so vast a collection
of them must have been furnished by way of tribute, to free the
country from these destructive animals. This superabundance
of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">murine</span></i> race must have been owing to their immense
fecundity, and to the comparatively tardy reproduction of the
<em>feline</em> species. The traces of this disproportion are to be found
in the early history of every country.—The ancient laws of
Wales estimate a cat at the price of as much corn as would be
sufficient to cover her, if she were suspended by the tail with
her fore-feet touching the ground.—See Howel Dha.—In Germany,
it is recorded that an army of rats, a larger animal of the

Darwin, which is peculiar to animated matter, and which alone
explains the whole mystery of organization. Our enchanter sits
on the ground, with his heels stretched out, his head erect, his
wand (or <em>hypothenuse</em>) resting on the extremities of his feet and
the tip of his nose (as is finely expressed in the engraving in the

His skin, by magical means, has acquired an indefinite power of

an opposite opinion. Much as he admired the poem in question, he thought
that the Darwinian structure of verse might be imitated by a writer possessed
of inferior poetical powers, and in a few days he produced in the same circle
part of the manuscript of <cite>Alexander’s Expedition to the Indian Ocean</cite> as an unpublished
work of the author of the <cite>Botanic Garden</cite>. The deception completely
succeeded, and some enthusiastic admirers of the latter work pointed out with
triumph “certain passages as proofs of the position that the author in his happier
efforts defied imitation”. Beddoes’s success was the more extraordinary, as
in the “Introduction” to a considerable extract from his poem which he printed
in the <cite>Annual Anthology</cite> for 1796, he states that he had never before written
twice as many lines of verse as the composition under notice consisted of.</p>

<p class='c007'>As <span class='sc'>Beddoes’s</span> imitation of <span class='sc'>Darwin</span> is seldom met with, it may not be out of
character in a work of the present nature to give a specimen of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a letter to Hannah More, Horace Walpole says: “The poetry is most admirable;
the similes beautiful, fine, and sometimes sublime; the author is a great
poet, and could raise the passions, and possesses all the requisites of the art.” In
another lively epistle to the Misses Berry (28th April, 1789), he says: “I send
you the most delicious poem upon earth. I can read this Second Part over and
over again for ever; for though it is so excellent, it is impossible to remember
anything so disjointed, except you consider it as a collection of short enchanting
Poems. ‘The Triumph of Flora,’ beginning at the fifty-ninth line, is most
beautifully and enchantingly imagined, and the twelve verses that by miracle
describe and comprehend the creation of the universe out of chaos, are, in my
opinion, the most sublime passage in any author, or in any of the few languages
with which I am acquainted.”—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c007'>[Darwin was acquainted with Rousseau. He was a man of great bodily and
intellectual vigour, irascible and imperious, a strong advocate of temperance, and
for many years an almost total abstainer. His professional fame was such that
George III. said he would take him as his physician if he would come to London.
He formed a botanical garden at Lichfield, about which Miss Seward wrote
some verses which suggested his <cite>Botanic Garden</cite>. The <cite>Loves of the Plants</cite> had a
singular success, and was praised in a joint poem by Cowper and Hayley.
It was translated into French, Portuguese, and Italian. Darwin himself is said
by Edgeworth to have admired the parody (<cite>Monthly Magazine</cite>, June and Sept.,
1802, p. 115). Coleridge (<cite><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Biographia Literaria</span></cite>, 1817, p. 19) speaks of the impression
which it made even upon good judges.</p>

Swiss were a free people, defending their liberties against a
tyrant. Moreover, they happened to be in alliance with
France at the time. No matter; <em>Burgundy</em> is since become
a province of France, and the French have acquired a property

There were a few who laughed indeed, but that was thought
